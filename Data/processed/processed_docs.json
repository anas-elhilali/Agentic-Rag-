It looks directly at the camera with wide, innocent eyes before slowly getting up and walking towards the end of the bed.\n**Scene 2 (00:02–00:03):** The same golden British Shorthair cat is curled up and sleeping soundly on a soft white pet bed on a wooden floor, partially covered by a white blanket.\n**Scene 3 (00:03–00:05):** A human hand holds a smartphone displaying the time 05:10 AM on its lock screen, with a picture of an orange cat as wallpaper.\n**Scene 4 (00:05–00:06):** The sleeping cat from Scene 2 is shown again. Five different smartphones are strategically placed around its pet bed, seemingly set as alarms.\n**Scene 5 (00:06–00:09):** All five smartphones simultaneously go off with ringing alarms. The cat, visibly startled, lifts its head abruptly from under the blanket and looks around with wide, confused eyes.\n**Scene 6 (00:09–00:11):** The cat meows loudly, expressing its clear annoyance and frustration at being woken up.\n**Scene 7 (00:11–00:12):** The cat sits on a white mat, looking utterly dejected and grumpy, with its eyes half-closed and ears slightly flattened.\n**Scene 8 (00:12–00:13):** The cat attempts to return to sleep on its pet bed, burying its face into the soft surface.\n**Scene 9 (00:13–00:16):** The five smartphones are now placed directly on top of the cat's blanket, covering its attempt to sleep. The cat lifts its head, looking puzzled and slightly exasperated.\n**Scene 10 (00:16–00:20):** The cat is seen trying to sleep again, nestled in its bed with the phones still around it. Suddenly, the alarms on all five phones ring once more.\n**Scene 11 (00:20–00:22):** The cat is jolted awake again, its eyes now wide and dilated with shock and intense irritation.\n**Scene 12 (00:22–00:23):** The cat sits on a white mat, looking extremely tired and mournful, with its head bowed down.\n**Scene 13 (00:23–00:25):** A human hand gently pokes the cat's front paw. The cat subtly shifts away, showing its reluctance to be touched.\n**Scene 14 (00:25–00:28):** The cat lies down on its white pet bed, looking resigned, and closes its eyes, appearing ready to finally rest.\n**Scene 15 (00:28–00:30):** The cat is now lying on its pet bed, surrounded by three green dancing cactus toys at the back and four small plush dog toys in front. The cactus toys are actively dancing and making sounds.\n**Scene 16 (00:30–00:31):** The cat is disturbed by the noisy toys and lifts its head, looking annoyed at them.\n**Scene 17 (00:31–00:33):** The cat attempts to ignore the noisy toys and tries to put its head back down to sleep.\n**Scene 18 (00:33–00:36):** The cat is fully awake, sitting up on its bed and looking at the dancing toys with an exasperated expression. It lets out another loud meow, clearly fed up with the disturbances.\n**Scene 19 (00:36–00:38):** A human hand uses a small golden spoon to scrape the last bits of yellow pulp from a small, hollowed-out mango seed. The golden British Shorthair cat is sitting on a white table, looking curiously at the process.\n**Scene 20 (00:38–00:41):** The human hand holds the empty mango seed next to the cat's paw, demonstrating that the size of the mango seed is comparable to the cat's paw.\n**Scene 21 (00:41–00:43):** Four pairs of intricately crafted miniature \"shoes\" made from mango seeds are displayed on a white fluffy surface. Each pair has unique decorations like green straps, black swoosh symbols, or green bows.\n**Scene 22 (00:43–00:46):** A human hand carefully puts one of the mango seed \"shoes\" onto the cat's paw, which appears to fit perfectly.\n**Scene 23 (00:46–00:48):** The cat's two back paws are shown wearing the yellow mango seed shoes, fitting snugly.\n**Scene 24 (00:48–00:50):** The cat is lying on its back, and all four of its paws are now adorned with the cute, decorated mango seed shoes.\n**Scene 25 (00:50–00:52):** Four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up neatly on a white rug, resembling \"cat loaves\" or large bread rolls. In front of each cat is a pair of the different mango seed shoes, suggesting each cat has its own pair. They all look content and relaxed."
