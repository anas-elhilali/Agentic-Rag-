Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A person is seen inside a golden wire cat cage, eating from a bowl, while four golden British Shorthair cats are gathered outside, looking up at the person. One cat is standing on its hind legs, stretching to peer into the cage.

Scene 2 (00:03–00:06): A golden British Shorthair cat is sitting on a white table next to a box of fried chicken and a bowl of instant noodles. A hand pushes the noodles towards the cat, but the cat turns its head away in refusal.

Scene 3 (00:06–00:08): A golden British Shorthair cat sniffs a raw chicken breast placed on a wooden cutting board, next to a carrot, as a person's hand points at the ingredients.

Scene 4 (00:08–00:17): A golden British Shorthair cat on a white table reacts with extreme disgust to a bowl of pureed cat food placed in front of it, making exaggerated gagging and recoiling motions.

Scene 5 (00:17–00:21): Three golden British Shorthair cats look up from the floor. Subsequently, a black and grey striped cat approaches a bowl of the pureed cat food on the floor, ignores it, and then attempts to 'bury' it with its paw, as if covering something unpleasant.

Scene 6 (00:21–00:26): A golden British Shorthair cat observes a bowl of the pureed cat food on the floor, which is now surrounded by numerous small, dead insects. The cat looks at the bowl with a questioning, confused expression.

Scene 7 (00:26–00:28): A person's hand gently pokes the paw of a golden British Shorthair cat sitting on the floor, which then looks up with a sad, pleading expression.

Scene 8 (00:28–00:33): A person grooms a golden British Shorthair cat lying on the wooden floor, accumulating a very large, spherical pile of light brown shed fur beside the cat.

Scene 9 (00:33–00:40): A person in striped pajamas sits on the floor next to a low white table, holding a spoon and a bowl of the pureed cat food. A golden British Shorthair cat sits on the table, watching the person. The person then tastes the food, reacts dramatically by lying prone on the floor, while the cat calmly observes the person.
