Here's a description of the video, formatted as requested:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A person's hand places a round biscuit on a light wooden floor in front of a golden British Shorthair cat. A transparent acrylic table-like object is positioned between the hand and the cat. In the background, another golden British Shorthair cat sits on a grey office chair.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): The person's hand slides the biscuit under the transparent acrylic table, while the cat watches intently.
Scene 3 (00:03–00:05): The person's hand slides the biscuit back out from under the table. The cat remains focused on the biscuit.
Scene 4 (00:05–00:07): The person's hand moves the biscuit under the transparent acrylic table again, but this time, it discreetly places the biscuit on top of the golden British Shorthair cat's head. The cat looks upwards, appearing puzzled.
Scene 5 (00:07–00:09): The cat is seen from a lower angle, looking straight ahead with the biscuit resting on its head, appearing confused as it searches for the biscuit. The second cat is still visible on the office chair in the background.
Scene 6 (00:09–00:12): A close-up shot of the cat, still with the biscuit on its head, as it looks around with a bewildered expression, seemingly unaware of the biscuit's location.
