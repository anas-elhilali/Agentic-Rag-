Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A person is writing in a large open book on a white table. A golden British Shorthair cat sits beside the book, looking intently downwards.

Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): The person continues writing, and the golden British Shorthair cat remains in the same position, observing the book.

Scene 3 (00:03–00:04): The golden British Shorthair cat looks up from the book, directly at the camera, with a wide-eyed, questioning expression.

Scene 4 (00:04–00:06): A person holds the golden British Shorthair cat on top of the open book and gently moves a pen towards the cat's paw, as if encouraging it to write. The cat observes the pen.

Scene 5 (00:06–00:08): The golden British Shorthair cat is held in a person's arms, looking directly at the camera with a stern expression. An open book is visible in the foreground.

Scene 6 (00:08–00:09): The golden British Shorthair cat is back on the white table, looking at the camera, and opens its mouth wide as if letting out a loud meow or yell.

Scene 7 (00:09–00:15): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up on the white table, all looking forward. An open book and a pen are placed in front of them. A grey tabby cat sits on the floor in the foreground, looking up at the golden cats. The golden cats then all look up with confused expressions. The grey tabby cat then approaches the table and uses its paw to push the pen, seemingly interacting with the book.
