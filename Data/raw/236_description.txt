Scene 1 (00:00-00:09): A wide shot of a brightly lit living room with white walls, a beige sofa adorned with large cat-face pillows, a glass coffee table, and a checkered rug. Five golden British Shorthair cats are visible, all engaged in self-grooming. One cat is on the floor in the foreground, licking its tail. Another cat is on the left side of the rug, grooming its back. A third cat is perched on the coffee table, licking its paw. A fourth cat is near the sofa on the right, grooming its hind leg. A fifth cat is partially visible behind the sofa.
