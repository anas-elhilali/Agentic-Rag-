Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): An adult golden British Shorthair cat sits on a green mat next to a small wooden bed where a golden British Shorthair kitten is sleeping under a bear-patterned blanket. A human hand enters the frame from the right, holding a stack of pink banknotes and begins to count them in front of the cats.

Scene 2 (00:01–00:06): The human hand continues counting the banknotes and repeatedly pokes the adult cat's nose. The adult cat reacts subtly, occasionally squinting or twitching its nose, while mostly observing the counting money. The kitten remains asleep in its bed.

Scene 3 (00:06–00:08): The human continues counting the money. The adult cat's expression changes from calm to a look of confusion, then to shock or realization as it looks between the money, the human, and the sleeping kitten.

Scene 4 (00:08–00:09): The camera zooms in on the kitten. The kitten is now wide awake, standing up in its bed, looking directly at the camera with its mouth open as if meowing loudly, appearing distressed or angry.
