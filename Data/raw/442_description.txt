Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): Four golden British Shorthair cats are gathered on a light blue wrinkled bedsheet. Three cats are lying down in the middle of the bed, while one cat sits alertly near the headboard. Dark wet stains are visible on the bedsheet in the foreground, and a human finger points towards them.

Scene 2 (00:02–00:03): A closer shot of one golden British Shorthair cat lying on the stained bedsheet, looking towards the camera with a slightly uneasy expression. A human finger points at this specific cat.

Scene 3 (00:03–00:05): A different golden British Shorthair cat is lying on a grey couch or bed backrest against a light pink wall. Its eyes are wide and focused as a human hand approaches, holding a small white toy toilet with a sticker on the lid.

Scene 4 (00:05–00:07): The cat is still lying down, observing the toy toilet. As the human hand places the toilet near its head, the cat's ears flatten, and it quickly startles and jumps away.

Scene 5 (00:07–00:09): The cat is now standing on the bed, looking back at the toy toilet held by the human hands, which are demonstrating its lid opening and closing. The cat appears curious yet cautious.

Scene 6 (00:09–00:13): The cat sits attentively on the bed, its wide eyes fixed on the toy toilet. The human hand pushes the toy closer. The cat briefly raises a paw as if to swat or investigate, then settles back, maintaining its intense gaze at the toilet.
