Scene 3 (00:02–00:04): The golden British Shorthair cat sits upright next to the laptop screen, intently watching it and reaching out with one paw as if to touch the display.
Scene 4 (00:04–00:08): The golden British Shorthair cat continues to bat at the laptop screen with its paw, causing the screen to glitch with horizontal lines. The cat appears surprised by the change.
