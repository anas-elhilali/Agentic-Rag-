Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:06): Four golden British Shorthair cats are sitting in a line, looking out a large glass door as fireworks explode in the distance. Another cat is seen lounging on a white sofa in the background. The scene is in black and white.
Scene 2 (00:06–00:08): Two golden British Shorthair cats stand on their hind legs, paws pressed against a windowpane, peering outside.
Scene 3 (00:08–00:11): Four golden British Shorthair cats sit in a row on a window ledge, looking intently out the window.
Scene 4 (00:11–00:15): A close-up shot of a golden British Shorthair cat with wide blue eyes staring directly at the camera, then its expression shifts to a more serious look.
Scene 5 (00:15–00:18): The same golden British Shorthair cat from the previous scene narrows its eyes, looking displeased or impatient.
Scene 6 (00:18–00:22): One golden British Shorthair cat sits patiently while another stands on its hind legs, trying to pull down the handle of a white door.
