Here's a detailed description of the video, scene by scene:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A person is in a bedroom, showing a laptop placed on a bed. The bed has a light blue comforter and a pink fitted sheet.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:02): The view shifts to under the bed, revealing several golden British Shorthair cats resting or looking out from the hidden space.
Scene 3 (00:02–00:03): A close-up shows one golden British Shorthair cat lying comfortably on the floor under the bed.
Scene 4 (00:03–00:05): A person holds a large clear acrylic sheet and slides it under the bed, effectively blocking the space underneath.
Scene 5 (00:05–00:07): A golden British Shorthair cat is on the floor, and a hand offers it a small white treat.
Scene 6 (00:07–00:08): The hand quickly moves away, as if enticing the cat to go under the bed.
Scene 7 (00:08–00:11): A golden British Shorthair cat runs towards the bed but bumps into the newly installed clear barrier, looking confused.
Scene 8 (00:11–00:15): The same cat walks along the side of the bed, attempting to find an entry point under it but is continuously blocked by the barrier.
Scene 9 (00:15–00:17): Three golden British Shorthair cats gather near the bed as a hand places treats on the floor right next to the clear barrier, out of their reach.
Scene 10 (00:17–00:19): A close-up shows one golden British Shorthair cat trying to lick the treats through the transparent barrier.
Scene 11 (00:19–00:20): All three golden British Shorthair cats are seen trying to reach the treats stuck behind the clear barrier under the bed.
Scene 12 (00:20–00:22): A white and brown Ragdoll cat approaches the bed, sniffing and pawing at the clear barrier, attempting to get under.
Scene 13 (00:22–00:24): Three golden British Shorthair cats are seen looking out from a small, confined space, possibly a storage room or closet.
Scene 14 (00:24–00:25): A hand closes a light-colored wooden door, presumably trapping the cats inside.
Scene 15 (00:25–00:27): A person's hand interacts with a tablet, selecting an audiobook.
Scene 16 (00:27–00:29): A night vision view of a bedroom shows a person sleeping peacefully in bed, covered by a white comforter.
Scene 17 (00:29–00:31): In the night vision view, a small white cat's face is seen peeking out from under the bed.
Scene 18 (00:31–00:35): The night vision view continues, showing the cat still peeking from under the bed. An image of the three golden British Shorthair cats trying to get under the bed is briefly superimposed over the scene, suggesting one of them might be the hidden cat.
Scene 19 (00:35–00:37): The small white cat fully emerges from under the bed in the night vision view.
Scene 20 (00:37–00:41): The white cat jumps onto the bed and walks over the sleeping person, seemingly disturbing them.
