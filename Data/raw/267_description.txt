Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): Two golden British Shorthair cats sit side-by-side with their backs to the camera, facing a glowing circular electric heater, seemingly enjoying its warmth.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:04): A close-up shot shows the glowing elements of the electric heater, then pans down to reveal a wooden floor and a large, plush toy.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:06): Two golden British Shorthair cats are now settled in a dark green cat bed. The cat in the foreground looks directly at the camera with wide, alert eyes, while the other looks to the left.
Scene 4 (00:06–00:09): One golden British Shorthair cat lies comfortably in the green cat bed, observing its surroundings, then looks calmly towards the camera.
Scene 5 (00:09–00:10): A golden British Shorthair cat rests in the green cat bed, appearing sleepy or slightly annoyed with its cheeks flattened.
Scene 6 (00:10–00:14): Two golden British Shorthair cats are in the cat bed. The cat in the foreground looks at the camera, and a human hand gently pokes its cheek, causing the cat to blink and react.
