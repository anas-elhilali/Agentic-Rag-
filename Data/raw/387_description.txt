Scene 3 (00:03–00:05): Two golden British Shorthair cats with green eyes are sitting on the white tiled floor, looking intently towards the camera. A smaller cat is in front of a larger cat.

Scene 5 (00:06–00:09): A hand gently pets the head of one of the golden British Shorthair cats, which then walks away, with the camera following its movement.
