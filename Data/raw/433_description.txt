Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:09): A close-up shot of a small, fluffy golden-brown kitten held in a person's hand. The kitten, with large blue eyes and a pink nose, repeatedly opens its mouth wide as if crying or meowing loudly.
Scene 2 (00:09–00:12): A person is seen playfully holding the kitten close to their face, appearing to kiss or nuzzle it. The kitten is held gently, looking up with a slightly bewildered expression.
Scene 3 (00:12–00:13): A golden British Shorthair cat is resting inside a wooden cat house. It has a slightly grumpy expression, and a tiny kitten is partially visible nestled beside it.
