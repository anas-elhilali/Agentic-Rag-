Scene 1 (00:00-00:06): A golden British Shorthair cat is perched on a white shelf, intently watching a man in casual attire. The man is using a wooden roller and a pink sheet of paper to press something against the white wall next to the shelf. In the background, another cat (grey and white) is visible on the floor near a table.
Scene 2 (00:06-00:08): The man pulls the pink paper away from the wall, inspects it with a smile, and then turns and walks away from the shelf. The golden British Shorthair cat remains on the shelf, looking towards where the man was.
