Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): Close-up of a golden British Shorthair cat with a fluffy coat, resting on a light blue or green blanket. The cat is seen from the side, looking away from the camera, with its eyes partially closed, appearing very relaxed.

Scene 2 (00:01–00:09): A human hand gently interacts with the golden British Shorthair cat, repeatedly plucking small amounts of loose fur from its head and neck area. The cat remains in a relaxed, sleepy state throughout, mostly with its eyes closed, seemingly comfortable with the grooming.

Scene 3 (00:09–00:11): The human hand holds up a visible clump of collected golden fur. The cat's eyes suddenly open wide in surprise or curiosity as it looks directly at the fur, then quickly glances away with a startled expression.
