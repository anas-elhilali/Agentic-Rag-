Scene 1 (00:00-00:02): A golden British Shorthair cat sits attentively on a white table, observing a whole fish with a lit candle on a green plate in front of it. A tablet displaying a man's face is positioned beside the cat.
Scene 2 (00:02-00:04): A hand re-lights the candle on the fish, while the golden cat appears slightly confused.
Scene 3 (00:04-00:06): The candle is re-lit again. The golden cat watches with an expectant expression.
Scene 4 (00:06-00:08): The hand blows out the candle, then re-lights it, causing the golden cat to look annoyed.
Scene 5 (00:08-00:10): The candle is re-lit, and the golden cat's expression shifts to frustration.
Scene 6 (00:10-00:12): The golden cat glares intensely at the candle as it is lit again.
Scene 7 (00:12-00:15): With a look of resignation, the golden cat watches the candle being re-lit one more time.
Scene 8 (00:15-00:19): A close-up shows the golden cat's exasperated face, with animated symbols appearing around its head.
Scene 9 (00:19-00:22): A golden cat sits on a white table. A hand places a bowl of blended cat food in front of it. The cat sniffs the food briefly, then turns and walks away.
Scene 10 (00:22-00:24): A small, lighter-colored golden cat on a wooden floor attempts to "bury" a bowl of the same blended cat food by pawing at the floor around it.
Scene 11 (00:24-00:26): A golden cat sniffs raw chicken breast and a carrot on a wooden cutting board.
Scene 12 (00:26-00:29): Three golden cats look up eagerly as a hand approaches with a bowl of the blended food. One cat then sniffs the bowl.
Scene 13 (00:29-00:33): A close-up of the blended cat food shows many dead mosquitoes floating in it. The golden cat sits nearby, looking down at the bowl surrounded by dead mosquitoes on the wooden floor.
Scene 14 (00:33-00:35): A close-up of the golden cat, with its eyes comically enlarged, staring directly at the camera.
Scene 15 (00:35-00:38): A close-up shot of the bowl of blended cat food, still containing numerous dead mosquitoes.
Scene 16 (00:38-00:40): The golden cat attempts to "bury" the food by scratching the floor next to the bowl. A black-and-grey marbled cat walks past, looking away in disgust.
Scene 17 (00:40-00:42): The golden cat continues to scratch the floor around the bowl.
Scene 18 (00:42-00:43): The black-and-grey marbled cat approaches the bowl, sniffs, and then walks away, performing a "burying" motion with its paws.
Scene 19 (00:43-00:44): A fluffy white and brown cat (Ragdoll) approaches the bowl, sniffs, and then backs away.
Scene 20 (00:44-00:48): A close-up of the golden cat. A human hand reaches out to touch its paw, but the cat quickly pulls its paw away.
Scene 21 (00:48-00:51): A person, presumably the owner, tries to feed the golden cat a spoonful of the blended food. The cat turns its head away, refusing.
Scene 22 (00:51-00:54): The person is now lying motionless on the floor next to the table, while the golden cat sits on the table looking down at them. A faint, ghost-like image of a cat passes through the person's body. Another cat is visible in the background.
Scene 23 (00:54-00:56): An ambulance is shown, a nurse gets into the back, and the ambulance drives away.
