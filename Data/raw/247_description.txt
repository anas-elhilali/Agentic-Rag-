Scene 4 (00:07–00:09): Three golden British Shorthair cats are gathered on a light-colored wooden floor around a black serving tray, actively eating small pieces of food from it. A fourth cat, a black and white tabby, is seated observantly in the background.
Scene 5 (00:09–00:13): The three golden British Shorthair cats look up simultaneously from their eating, staring intently at something off-screen with wide, curious eyes.

Scene 9 (00:16–00:20): Three golden British Shorthair cats are lying close together on a white checkered mat, looking sulky and upset. An empty black tray with only crumbs is in front of them. A human hand gently pokes one of the cats.
Scene 10 (00:20–00:22): Several boxes and numerous colorful pouches of cat treats are displayed on the floor. A human hand gestures towards them.
Scene 11 (00:22–00:23): The three golden British Shorthair cats are lying down on the mat, looking eagerly at the pile of cat treats with their mouths slightly open, as if drooling.
