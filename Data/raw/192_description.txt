Scene 4 (00:05-00:08): The golden British Shorthair cat presses its paws against the glass of the enclosure, attempting to interact with the chick inside, which is near the glass. The cat appears playful and curious.
Scene 5 (00:08-00:10): A golden British Shorthair cat stands on its hind legs beside the glass enclosure, batting playfully at the glass with its front paws, seemingly trying to reach the chick within. A cat tree is visible in the background.
Scene 6 (00:10-00:13): A golden British Shorthair cat lies relaxed on the light wooden floor, with a small, dark-colored chick walking near its head. The cat appears calm and gentle, not showing any aggression towards the chick.

Scene 8 (00:15-00:19): A human hand opens the lid of the glass enclosure. The golden British Shorthair cat quickly tries to put its head inside, but the hand gently pushes it back, preventing it from entering.
Scene 9 (00:19-00:22): A human hand holds a small chick directly in front of a golden British Shorthair cat. The cat looks intently at the chick but makes no move to harm it, appearing curious.
