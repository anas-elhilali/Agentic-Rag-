Scene 10 (00:15–00:17): A human hand holds a light-orange/cream kitten upright by its front paws, making it stand on its hind legs. The kitten looks at the camera with a slightly displeased expression.

Scene 17 (00:26–00:27): The light-orange/cream kitten is held upright by the human hand, looking directly at the camera and opening its mouth as if meowing or speaking.
