Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): Three golden British Shorthair kittens are around a lime green litter box. Two are inside, one playing with the yellow litter, another looking out. The third, lighter-furred kitten is outside, its paw on the edge of the box.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:04): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten is on a wooden floor, sniffing at a small pile of simulated feces next to a light green mat.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:07): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten is inside the litter box, pawing at the litter. A human hand gently reaches in and lifts the kitten.
Scene 4 (00:07–00:09): Close-up of the lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten held by a human hand, looking directly at the camera with its tongue slightly sticking out.
Scene 5 (00:09–00:11): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten is back in the litter box, looking at the camera with its tongue slightly out.
Scene 6 (00:11–00:13): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten sits on the wooden floor, leaning its paws on the side of the lime green litter box.
Scene 7 (00:13–00:15): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten observes from outside as a slightly larger, older golden British Shorthair cat actively digs in the litter box.
Scene 8 (00:15–00:16): Close-up of the older golden British Shorthair cat digging vigorously in the litter.
Scene 9 (00:16–00:19): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten sits upright on the wooden floor beside the litter box, gradually closing its eyes and falling asleep in a sitting position.
Scene 10 (00:19–00:22): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten walks across a large, soft, burger-shaped cushion, then lies down and curls up to sleep on it.
Scene 11 (00:22–00:26): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten is fast asleep on the burger-shaped cushion, while the older golden British Shorthair cat watches from behind, then yawns.
Scene 12 (00:27–00:29): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten watches from outside the litter box as the older golden British Shorthair cat demonstrates digging in the litter.
Scene 13 (00:29–00:31): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten is inside the litter box, actively digging and pawing at the litter.
Scene 14 (00:31–00:33): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten sits in the litter box, looking at the camera with its tongue slightly out, appearing confident.
Scene 15 (00:33–00:34): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten enthusiastically digs and paws at the litter in the litter box.
Scene 16 (00:34–00:39): The lighter-furred golden British Shorthair kitten is curled up and sleeping in the corner of the lime green litter box. The video then shows a split screen comparing the sleeping kitten in the current litter box with a past image of the older cat (presumably as a kitten) also sleeping curled up in a similar litter box.
