Here is a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): A golden British Shorthair cat lies on a pink blanket next to a person's head, licking the person's hair. A hand gently pushes the cat away, but the cat persists, playfully licking again before an annoyed expression.
Scene 2 (00:04–00:06): The same golden British Shorthair cat is held by a person who is using a cotton swab to clean its ear. The cat sits calmly, eyes half-closed, on a wooden floor next to a glass bowl containing a green liquid.
Scene 3 (00:06–00:11): Three golden British Shorthair cats are on a grey sofa. One cat lies in the middle, appearing somewhat annoyed, while the two other cats on either side are actively licking its head, seemingly grooming it.
Scene 4 (00:11–00:13): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on a grey sofa, looking dishevelled and unhappy. Its fur on top of its head is wet and spiky, indicating it has just had a bath.
