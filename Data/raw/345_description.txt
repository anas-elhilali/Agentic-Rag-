Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A transparent, elongated tube extends from an air conditioner, and a small, white cat is visible inside the tube as it moves along.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:08): The camera follows the transparent tube as it stretches across the floor, passing a wooden table and continuing under a metal and wood staircase. A grey tabby cat is seen lying on its back next to the tube under the staircase.
Scene 3 (00:08–00:12): The transparent tube leads to a multi-level white wire enclosure, where several golden British Shorthair cats are housed in different compartments, receiving airflow from the tube.
Scene 4 (00:12–00:24): A golden British Shorthair cat is tucked under a white blanket in a bed, resting beside a smartphone. The cat repeatedly wakes up, looks intently at the phone, then closes its eyes and drifts back to sleep, only to be disturbed again. In the final moment, the cat wakes up, glances at the phone, and then pulls the blanket over its head in apparent annoyance.
Scene 5 (00:24–00:30): An adult golden British Shorthair cat sits attentively next to a fluffy, white, flower-shaped pet bed. Inside the bed, a very small, golden British Shorthair kitten is actively vocalizing, mewing loudly at the adult cat.
