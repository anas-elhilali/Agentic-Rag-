Here is the video description:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A small golden British Shorthair kitten sits on a light wooden floor, looking towards a person's legs. A light yellow armchair and a TV are visible in the background.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:04): The kitten cautiously approaches a person's foot, which is covered by a white sock, and sniffs it.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:07): Two golden British Shorthair kittens are on the wooden floor. One kitten is sitting and looking at the camera, while another is partially visible, appearing to be eating something on the floor. The sitting kitten then looks towards the other kitten with a curious expression.
Scene 4 (00:07–00:11): A close-up of a golden British Shorthair kitten on the wooden floor. The kitten looks up, then down, then sniffs the floor, and finally looks up again with a slightly puzzled expression.
