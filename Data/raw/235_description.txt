Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A gray tabby cat sits on the back of a large lion. Both animals are positioned on a wooden porch or deck, facing forward at night, viewed through a night vision camera.
Scene 2 (00:04–00:07): The same gray tabby cat is now sitting on the back of a large tiger. Both animals are facing forward inside a room, possibly a living room, at night, viewed through a night vision camera.
Scene 3 (00:08–00:11): The gray tabby cat is perched on the head of a large polar bear. The polar bear stands on a wooden porch or deck at night, with three smaller gray tabby cats sitting in front of it, all viewed through a night vision camera.
