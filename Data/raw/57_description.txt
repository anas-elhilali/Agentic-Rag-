Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A red bag of rice is seen on a kitchen counter, with a significant amount of rice spilled around its base. A hand points to a small hole in the lower part of the bag, indicating the source of the spill.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:04): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on the white kitchen counter, looking towards the spilled rice and then directly at the camera with wide, innocent green eyes.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:06): The same golden British Shorthair cat is now on the floor near a white cabinet, sniffing the floor where small, dark, oblong droppings (mouse droppings) are scattered.
Scene 4 (00:06–00:09): A human hand holds a black, spring-loaded mousetrap near the cat. The cat watches intently as the hand opens the trap and then places it on the clean tile floor.
Scene 5 (00:09–00:14): The human hand places a small piece of bait into the set mousetrap. The trap accidentally snaps on the human's finger, causing them to flinch and shake their hand.
Scene 6 (00:14–00:18): A different type of trap, a black wire cage mousetrap, is placed on the floor near the golden British Shorthair cat. A human hand, with a bandaged finger, places bait inside the cage. The cat sniffs the bait inside the cage, trying to reach it. The human then gently pets the cat's head.
Scene 7 (00:18–00:20): The cat sniffs the trap and then looks up, being petted by the human hand.
Scene 8 (00:20–00:24): Four golden British Shorthair cats are seen from behind, sitting in a neat row facing a corner of the kitchen, seemingly on guard. The wire cage trap is visible on the floor near them.
Scene 9 (00:24–00:26): A large bag of cat food is shown on the floor, followed by a close-up of one of the golden British Shorthair cats sitting beside the bag. A human hand scoops food from the bag into a bowl.
Scene 10 (00:26–00:31): The scooped cat food is poured into a paw-shaped bowl. The cat observes as the food is added. The scene then shows all four cats eating from their individual paw-shaped bowls on a wooden stand.
Scene 11 (00:31–00:34): A close-up shows a scoop full of the cat food, highlighting its ring-like shape. Then the cat is seen eating from its bowl.
Scene 12 (00:34–00:36): A human hand closes a sliding glass door, effectively confining the four cats to the kitchen area where the cage trap is still present.
Scene 13 (00:37–00:39): The video transitions to show the closed sliding glass door, revealing the cats still inside the kitchen.
Scene 14 (00:39–00:46): The camera zooms in to reveal one of the golden British Shorthair cats with its head comically stuck inside the wire cage trap, struggling to get out while attempting to reach the bait. The other three cats watch from a distance.
Scene 15 (00:46–00:49): Close-up of the cat struggling in the trap. The three other cats are observing the trapped cat from different angles.
