Here is a description of the video, formatted as requested:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): Three small, fluffy golden British Shorthair kittens are lined up on a white fluffy blanket on a windowsill, each with a blue bottle cap in front of them.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:02): A hand places blue bottle caps around the bodies of the three kittens as if adorning them with sashes.
Scene 3 (00:02–00:04): A close-up of one golden British Shorthair kitten lying on the white blanket. A hand gently places a blue bottle cap on its head.
Scene 4 (00:04–00:05): The kitten, still lying with the blue cap on its head, is gently poked on the nose by a finger.
Scene 5 (00:05–00:06): The kitten slightly lifts its head and blinks, reacting to the poke.
Scene 6 (00:06–00:08): A hand gently pets the kitten's head, stroking its fur.
Scene 7 (00:08–00:10): A hand gently cups the kitten's face, holding its chin and cheek. The kitten makes a soft meow sound.
Scene 8 (00:10–00:13): A circular profile picture displays a golden British Shorthair kitten looking upwards with wide, curious eyes.
