Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): A group of four adult golden British Shorthair cats and one small golden kitten are intently observing a large, raw fish submerged in water within a metal basin on a wooden floor. The kitten is on the right, appearing small next to the large fish.
Scene 2 (00:04–00:09): The small golden kitten investigates the large, raw fish lying on a tiled floor. It sniffs and gently nudges the fish's head, appearing to try and interact with it.
Scene 3 (00:09–00:12): The kitten sits beside the large, motionless fish on the tiled floor, looking at it with a seemingly dejected or contemplative expression.
Scene 4 (00:13–00:15): The small golden kitten is submerged in a large metal bowl filled with dry cat kibble and dried fish treats, eagerly eating from the center.
Scene 5 (00:15–00:18): A close-up shows the kitten with its head buried in the cat kibble and dried fish treats, continuing to eat vigorously from the large bowl.
Scene 6 (00:18–00:21): Another white cat approaches the large bowl as the golden kitten continues to eat, sniffing the edges of the bowl, curious about the food.
Scene 7 (00:23–00:25): The golden kitten approaches a large black dual-compartment feeder with one side filled with cat kibble and the other with water, ready to eat.
Scene 8 (00:25–00:28): An adult golden British Shorthair cat joins the kitten at the dual-compartment feeder, and both cats are now actively eating kibble from it.
Scene 9 (00:28–00:31): The golden kitten sits in front of the dual-compartment feeder, looking directly at the camera with a solemn or questioning expression.
