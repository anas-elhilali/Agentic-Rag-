Here is a detailed description of the video, scene by scene:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A fluffy gray cat attempts to squeeze through a transparent plastic tube on a pink striped bed. Its head is already through, but its body struggles to follow, appearing compressed within the narrow space.

Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): Three golden British Shorthair cats, all fluffy and similar in appearance, are sitting in a neat row on a pink striped bed. Two transparent plastic tubes of different diameters are placed in front of them, suggesting an upcoming challenge.

Scene 3 (00:03–00:05): A human hand places a small can of wet cat food (Fancy Feast brand) at the end of the wider transparent tube on the bed. One of the golden British Shorthair cats approaches the tube, showing curiosity.

Scene 4 (00:05–00:07): A close-up shows a golden British Shorthair cat sniffing the can of cat food placed inside the wider tube. Its head is slightly inserted into the tube as it tries to reach the food. A hand gently pets the cat's head.

Scene 5 (00:07–00:09): One of the golden British Shorthair cats (identified as "Laoda") stands at the entrance of the wider tube, looking at the cat food can placed within. The other two cats watch from the background on the bed.

Scene 6 (00:09–00:12): "Laoda" attempts to "cheat" the challenge by reaching for the food from the side of the tube, instead of entering it. A human hand intervenes, stopping the cat from cheating, and gently pets its head. The cat appears disappointed.

Scene 7 (00:12–00:15): The second golden British Shorthair cat (identified as "Lao Er") is presented with the empty wider transparent tube. The cat appears uninterested in the challenge and does not attempt to go through it.

Scene 8 (00:15–00:17): To encourage "Lao Er," two human hands place three different cans of wet cat food, seemingly increasing the appeal, at the end of the wider tube.

Scene 9 (00:17–00:20): "Lao Er" slowly and carefully begins to enter the wider tube, head first, moving towards the multiple cans of food. Its head and front paws are inside the tube as it starts eating.

Scene 10 (00:20–00:22): "Lao Er" successfully navigates through the entire length of the wider tube and continues to enjoy eating from the cat food cans at the end.

Scene 11 (00:22–00:24): "Lao Er" is seen relaxing comfortably on a pink pillow, being petted by a human hand, while another golden British Shorthair cat watches from the side, awaiting its turn.

Scene 12 (00:24–00:26): A long, flat Advent calendar-like box, with multiple compartments, is laid out on the bed. Several cans of cat food are visible at the far end of the box, indicating a larger reward for a successful challenge.

Scene 13 (00:26–00:29): A human hand opens one of the compartments on the Advent calendar, revealing a small can of cat food. The golden British Shorthair cat (identified as "Xiaosan") watches intently as the can is picked up and offered to it.

Scene 14 (00:29–00:32): "Xiaosan" is positioned at the start of the narrower transparent tube. A human hand encourages the cat to enter. The cat lowers its head and begins to crawl into the tube, wiggling its body forward.

Scene 15 (00:32–00:33): A close-up shot from inside the tube shows "Xiaosan"'s face and front paws as it slowly tries to push its way through the narrow space.

Scene 16 (00:33–00:37): "Xiaosan" becomes stuck halfway through the narrower tube, unable to move forward or backward. Its body appears visibly compressed and struggles within the tube.

Scene 17 (00:37–00:39): "Xiaosan" is finally pulled free from the tube by the human hand, looking slightly disoriented or annoyed by the experience. It shakes its head.

Scene 18 (00:39–00:40): The video concludes with "Xiaosan" sitting in front of the empty tube, looking at it and then towards the camera, seemingly pondering the challenge. A brief static screen appears at the very end.
