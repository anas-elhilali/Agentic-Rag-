Here is a description of the video about cats, broken down by scenes with timestamps, designed to provide enough detail for script generation:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A golden British Shorthair cat lies on a wooden floor, observing three golden-brown kittens eating from a low food bowl. A white air purifier is in the background.

Scene 2 (00:02–00:03): Three golden-brown kittens are sleeping soundly in a row on a white bedspread, positioned near a window with sheer white curtains.

Scene 3 (00:03–00:07): Four mature golden British Shorthair cats are lined up asleep on a white sofa. Below them, in a wooden playpen, three tiny newborn kittens (one golden, two dark) are visible. A person's hands then lift and present the three tiny kittens to the camera.

Scene 4 (00:07–00:09): An overhead view shows the three newborn kittens (one golden-brown, two dark brown/grey) lying on a white mat inside a wooden playpen.

Scene 5 (00:09–00:13): The golden British Shorthair mother cat is in the playpen. She gently picks up the golden-brown kitten by its neck and repositions it, then lies down and nurses the kitten.

Scene 6 (00:13–00:19): The mother cat is lying down with the golden-brown kitten next to her, nursing. A person's finger points towards one of the dark brown/grey kittens in the playpen. The mother cat then looks directly at the camera with comically enlarged, green eyes (visual effect).

Scene 7 (00:19–00:20): The two dark brown/grey newborn kittens are moving around on the white mat inside the playpen.

Scene 8 (00:20–00:23): A hand holds up a pink, multi-nipple nursing bottle designed for kittens. The scene then shifts to a person preparing formula: pouring water into a glass with powder, mixing it with an electric whisk, and then pouring the milky mixture into the pink nursing bottle.

Scene 9 (00:23–00:24): A person holds a tiny golden-brown kitten, guiding it to nurse from one of the nipples of the pink bottle.

Scene 10 (00:24–00:25): An overhead shot of the three newborn kittens (one golden, two dark) are seen gathering around the pink nursing bottle within the yellow and white checkered playpen.

Scene 11 (00:25–00:27): A close-up of a person holding a golden-brown kitten as it actively nurses from the pink bottle.

Scene 12 (00:27–00:34): A golden British Shorthair cat watches attentively from a kitchen counter as a person fills a white kettle and then a small pot with water from a modern faucet. The person then fills a blue ceramic bowl with water, and the cat proceeds to drink from it.

Scene 13 (00:34–00:36): A close-up of a person holding a golden-brown kitten as it nurses from the pink bottle.

Scene 14 (00:36–00:37): The three newborn kittens (one golden, two dark) are seen sleeping closely together on the white mat in the playpen.

Scene 15 (00:37–00:43): The golden British Shorthair mother cat is in the playpen, sniffing the pink nursing bottle. A person's hand gently pushes the mother cat's head away from the bottle. The mother cat looks at the person with a slight expression of annoyance.
