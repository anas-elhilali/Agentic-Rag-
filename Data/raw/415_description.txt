Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): Three golden British Shorthair cats are lying in a green pet bed, positioned closely in front of a glowing orange electric heater. Wisps of steam or smoke are visibly rising from their fur, especially from the cats closest to the camera.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:02): A close-up view of one golden British Shorthair cat resting comfortably in the green bed. Steam continues to rise from its head and ears, and the cat appears sleepy or content with its eyes half-closed.
Scene 3 (00:02–00:03): The same golden British Shorthair cat lifts its head, eyes now wide open and attentive, as steam still gently rises from its fur.
Scene 4 (00:03–00:04): The cat looks upwards with a blissful or dreamy expression, eyes closed, seemingly enjoying the warmth while the steam persists around its head.
Scene 5 (00:04–00:05): Two golden British Shorthair cats are side-by-side in the green bed, both facing the camera. Steam is actively rising from the fur on their heads, and they look slightly confused or surprised.
Scene 6 (00:05–00:06): A detailed close-up of one golden British Shorthair cat's face, highlighting several short, singed whiskers near its nose and mouth.
Scene 7 (00:06–00:08): The golden British Shorthair cat is lying down, looking away with its head lowered and ears slightly flattened, conveying an expression of being upset or embarrassed.
