Scene 1 (00:00-00:03): A top-down view of a kitchen shows a silver British Shorthair cat walking towards a golden British Shorthair cat, both on the wooden floor.
Scene 2 (00:03-00:07): A close-up of the golden British Shorthair cat shows its front paws appearing swollen, and the cat looks sad. Its paws are then shown to be very swollen, and it looks directly at the camera with sad green eyes.
Scene 3 (00:07-00:15): The golden cat sits next to a glass fishbowl containing two goldfish. It intently watches the fish, then begins to lap water from the top level of the fishbowl, repeatedly extending its tongue.
Scene 4 (00:15-00:27): A person lies on a white surface with their face covered by a clear plastic bag. A hand applies a substance to the bag, and four golden cats gather around the person's head, eagerly licking the bag. A straw is placed through the bag to allow the person to breathe.
Scene 5 (00:27-00:31): A wider shot shows the person lying on a rug, completely surrounded by multiple cats of various colors, including golden, black and white, and white. Several cats are still clustered around the person's head, while others are scattered around the body.
