Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:01): A person sits on a bed with a black and white cat, while a large clear plastic tube extends from an air conditioner towards the floor.
Scene 2 (00:01-00:07): The clear plastic tube is shown extending from the air conditioner, across the floor, past a door, and into another room.
Scene 3 (00:07-00:14): The plastic tube enters a pink tent where four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up. Air is blowing from the tube into the tent, providing them with cool air. The cats appear relaxed and enjoy the breeze.
Scene 4 (00:14-00:19): A person sits inside a large, transparent mesh tent, grooming a golden British Shorthair cat with a brush. Large amounts of loose fur are visible and flying around inside the tent. Two other golden cats watch from outside the tent.
Scene 5 (00:19-00:23): A closer view of the person grooming the cat, with fur clearly flying. Two golden cats in the foreground look wide-eyed and surprised as if reacting to the flying fur.
Scene 6 (00:23-00:30): Three golden British Shorthair cats are lined up on a white console table, observing the person grooming another cat inside the mesh tent. They look on with expressions of shock and awe at the amount of fur being removed.
