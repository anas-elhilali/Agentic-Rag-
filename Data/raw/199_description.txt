Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): Three golden British Shorthair cats are eating from their individual food bowls, which are lined up against a white wall on a wooden floor. A fourth golden British Shorthair cat sits directly behind the last eating cat, observing the scene with a curious expression, not eating from a bowl.

Scene 2 (00:02–00:04): The three golden British Shorthair cats continue to eat from their bowls. The fourth golden British Shorthair cat has now moved forward to join the line, facing the wall as if eating, but without a bowl in front of it.

Scene 3 (00:04–00:07): A top-down view shows all four golden British Shorthair cats lined up. The first three are actively eating from their bowls, while the fourth cat is positioned at the end of the line, appearing to mimic eating.

Scene 4 (00:07–00:11): The three golden British Shorthair cats continue to eat. The fourth cat, at the end of the line, briefly lifts its head, looking around with a slightly awkward expression, then lowers it again to resume its pretense of eating.
