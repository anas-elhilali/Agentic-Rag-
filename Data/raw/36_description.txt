Scene 1 (00:00–00:05): A person holds a white portable heater/dryer device over three golden British Shorthair cats lying in a row on a grey couch, seemingly styling their fur by adding small, shiny, foil-like pieces to their heads.
Scene 2 (00:05–00:07): Close-up of one golden British Shorthair cat with several small, shiny, foil-like pieces on its head, looking upwards with a confused expression.
Scene 3 (00:07–00:11): The golden British Shorthair cat now appears annoyed, looking down with narrowed eyes, shaking its head as if to remove the pieces.
Scene 4 (00:11–00:12): The three golden British Shorthair cats are seen lined up on the couch, with their heads lowered, appearing dejected or annoyed, with some of the foil pieces still attached.
