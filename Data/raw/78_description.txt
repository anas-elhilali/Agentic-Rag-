Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:05): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lying in a neat row on a gray bed, intently watching an animated cartoon (Tom and Jerry) on a tablet propped up on a pillow. Their gaze is fixed on the screen, showing deep concentration.
Scene 2 (00:05–00:07): A human hand reaches into the frame and taps the tablet, pausing the cartoon. The four cats immediately look up from the screen with expressions of confusion and surprise.
Scene 3 (00:07–00:08): The human hand points a finger at the cats, who appear dejected.
Scene 4 (00:08–00:10): As the human hand attempts to close the cartoon on the tablet, a cat's paw reaches out and taps the screen, seemingly restarting or preventing the cartoon from closing.
Scene 5 (00:10–00:13): The tablet now displays a video of a different white cat. The four golden cats are once again completely engrossed, watching the new video with wide, focused eyes.
Scene 6 (00:13–00:15): The human hand reaches for the tablet again. The cats swiftly react, batting at the hand with their paws, clearly annoyed by the interruption and determined to continue watching.
