Scene 2 (00:03–00:05): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lying in a row, intently watching "Tom and Jerry" on a laptop. Two small kittens, one white and one light brown, are also present, looking at a miniature laptop prop beside them.

Scene 12 (00:24–00:26): One golden British Shorthair cat is lying down. A hand gently scratches the head of the other golden British Shorthair cat, which is standing.

Scene 15 (00:29–00:30): The scene is split into two frames. The top frame shows hands needle felting a large, light brown felt object. The bottom frame shows two golden British Shorthair cats on a white mat while a person's hands add detailed facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) to the felted head.
Scene 16 (00:30–00:31): The felted head is almost complete. A hand uses a small brush to apply pink color to the inside of a felted ear. A golden British Shorthair cat observes in the background.
