Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A red electric hot pot with two compartments sits on a glass table. One compartment is boiling with broth and noodles, the other contains clear water. Below the table, the fluffy tail of a golden cat is visible.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:02): The camera pans slightly, revealing several transparent containers of raw meat and corn kernels on the glass table, next to the hot pot. Two golden cats are now partially visible below the table.
Scene 3 (00:02–00:04): Two golden British Shorthair cats are seen sitting upright under the glass table on a brown and white checkered mat, both looking up intently at the food displayed on the tabletop.
Scene 4 (00:04–00:07): The two golden British Shorthair cats remain under the table, fixated on the food above. They are sitting close to each other, their heads tilted back, appearing eager. Cat-shaped pillows are visible on a couch in the background.
Scene 5 (00:07–00:10): One of the golden British Shorthair cats, with striking green eyes, turns its head slightly to look at the other cat, while both continue to gaze longingly at the hot pot and various food containers on the glass table above them.
