Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A golden British Shorthair cat stands beside a toilet, intently observing the toilet bowl which is filled with numerous metal spikes and illuminated by a blue light.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:04): A second golden British Shorthair cat joins the first, and both cats are now peering into the spiked toilet bowl from the side.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:07): One cat leans further into the toilet bowl while the other sits beside it, both appearing curious and slightly perplexed by the spiked interior.
Scene 4 (00:07–00:11): Both golden British Shorthair cats look up towards the camera with wide, expressive eyes, appearing frustrated or bewildered by the spiked toilet.
