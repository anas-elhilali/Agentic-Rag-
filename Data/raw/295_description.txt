Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A pink birthday cake with two cat faces drawn on it and a yellow star-shaped candle with the number "2" is centered on a wooden table. The paws of several cats are visible in the blurry background.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:07): The camera pulls back, revealing four golden British Shorthair cats sitting in a perfectly aligned row on a grey sofa behind the cake. All cats are focused on the cake. A white and brown cat is partially visible on the far left.
Scene 3 (00:07–00:09): The camera pans slightly to the left, showing a white and brown Ragdoll cat sitting on the sofa next to the four golden cats, all looking at the cake.
Scene 4 (00:09–00:11): The four golden British Shorthair cats on the sofa are looking down with sad, disappointed expressions, while the cake remains in the foreground.
Scene 5 (00:11–00:13): The four golden British Shorthair cats instantly change their expressions to bright and hopeful, looking up at the cake with wide eyes. The white and brown cat is also visible on the far left.
