Here are the descriptions for the videos about cats:

**Video 1:**

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A golden British Shorthair cat is actively chewing and playing with a white cable on a light wooden floor, appearing quite engrossed in its activity.

Scene 2 (00:03–00:05): The same golden British Shorthair cat sits on the wooden floor next to a white cable that now appears frayed and damaged. The cat looks away with a slight side-eye, appearing somewhat guilty or innocent.

Scene 3 (00:05–00:08): A close-up shot shows the cat's face. Its eyes are wide and round, looking directly at the camera with a surprised or bewildered expression.

Scene 4 (00:08–00:12): A close-up of the cat held in a person's hands. The cat's expression has changed to a sad or aggrieved look, with its eyes narrowed and mouth downturned.

**Video 2:**

Scene 1 (00:13–00:14): A woman is seen applying makeup while sitting on the floor at a low table. A golden cat sits on the table, watching her, and another cat is visible resting in a yellow armchair behind her.

Scene 2 (00:14–00:17): A man sits on a white sofa, engrossed in his phone, gently petting the golden cat that rests on his lap. Several large cat-face pillows are arranged behind him on the sofa.

Scene 3 (00:17–00:19): The scene changes to show a full skeleton sitting on the white sofa, wearing the man's clothes. A small piece of bone is on the floor, and the cat-face pillows remain on the sofa.

Scene 4 (00:19–00:22): The woman is still at the low table, but now surrounded by scattered skeletal remains on the table and floor as she continues to apply makeup, seemingly unfazed.
