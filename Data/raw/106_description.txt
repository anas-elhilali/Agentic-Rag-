Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): Four golden British Shorthair cats are seated in pairs on two light-colored chairs in a living room. The two cats on the left chair are looking forward, as are the two on the right chair. A cat tree and a sofa are visible in the background.

Scene 2 (00:04–00:06): The four golden British Shorthair cats remain seated in pairs on the two chairs. All of their heads are now lowered, looking downwards.

Scene 3 (00:06–00:09): A close-up view of two golden British Shorthair cats sitting side-by-side on one chair. Both cats have their heads lowered. A person's hand reaches into the frame and gently pokes the cat on the right. The cat briefly lifts its head, then lowers it again.

Scene 4 (00:09–00:10): A close-up of one golden British Shorthair cat sitting on a chair with its head initially lowered. The cat then slightly lifts its head and looks to the left, away from the camera.

Scene 5 (00:10–00:14): A wider shot showing all four golden British Shorthair cats again, seated in pairs on the two chairs, similar to Scene 2. All four cats have their heads lowered, looking downwards.
