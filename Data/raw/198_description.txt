Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): Three golden British Shorthair cats are lined up neatly on a white couch, looking towards the camera.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:05): A fourth golden British Shorthair cat appears on the far left, extending the line of cats across the couch.
Scene 3 (00:05–00:09): The face of the second golden British Shorthair cat from the left is comically distorted and stretched, as if a filter is being applied.
Scene 4 (00:09–00:13): The faces of the third and fourth golden British Shorthair cats from the left become distorted and stretched, while the first two cats' faces return to their normal appearance.
Scene 5 (00:13–00:18): All four golden British Shorthair cats are visible on the couch. The two cats on the right have comically distorted and stretched faces, while the two on the left remain normal. A subtle sparkling effect overlays the entire scene.
