Scene 1 (00:00-00:02): A hand holds a white charging adapter connected by a yellow cable to a smartphone. The hand is positioned above three golden British Shorthair cats, lying in a neat row on a cream-colored couch. The cats appear calm and relaxed.
Scene 2 (00:02-00:09): The hand places the charging adapter onto the head of the middle cat. The smartphone screen, held by the other hand, displays a rapidly increasing numerical value, simulating the cat "charging" money. The cats remain still and docile.
Scene 3 (00:09-00:13): The numerical value on the smartphone stops increasing. The hand moves the charging adapter from the middle cat to the head of the left cat, but the displayed value on the screen does not change. The cats continue to lie motionless on the couch.
