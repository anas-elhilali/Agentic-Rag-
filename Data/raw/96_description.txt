Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A light gray tabby cat with a small orange peel on its back walks awkwardly across a light-colored floor, showing slight hesitation in its movement.

Scene 2 (00:02–00:03): Several golden British Shorthair cats, some real and some plush pillows, are arranged on a light grey sofa. In the foreground, on a wooden table, rests a spiky durian peel and a smooth, yellowish pomelo peel.

Scene 3 (00:03–00:05): A golden British Shorthair cat on the sofa reacts with a disgusted expression, backing its head away, as a human hand brings a spiky durian peel close to its nose.

Scene 4 (00:06–00:12): A person places a large, smooth yellow pomelo peel on the back of a golden British Shorthair cat standing on a wooden floor. The cat initially looks at the person, then attempts to walk but struggles, moving very slowly and stiffly before collapsing onto its side and remaining still with the peel on its back.

Scene 5 (00:13–00:21): Another golden British Shorthair cat is shown with the yellow pomelo peel on its back. It tries to walk but moves very low to the ground, almost crawling or dragging itself, appearing highly uncomfortable, with the peel remaining on its back.

Scene 6 (00:21–00:23): A golden British Shorthair cat with a banana peel on its back shakes its body vigorously, causing the peel to fall off, and then walks away.

Scene 7 (00:23–00:32): A white robot vacuum cleaner emerges from its charging dock and begins cleaning a wooden floor, successfully navigating to pick up small debris and moving under a sofa.

Scene 8 (00:32–00:40): A third golden British Shorthair cat has the yellow pomelo peel placed on its back. It attempts to move but immediately lies down, flattening itself against the floor, and tries to crawl while looking confused and bewildered with the peel still on its back.
