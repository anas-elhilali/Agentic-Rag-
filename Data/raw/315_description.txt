Here is a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:05): A golden British Shorthair cat sits upright on a light-colored surface, intently watching a smartphone held by a person. The phone displays a video that changes content, and the catâ€™s expression shifts from focused to a wide-eyed, surprised look.

Scene 2 (00:05-00:13): The same golden British Shorthair cat is seen lying on a wooden floor in a slightly flattened, submissive pose. Various objects are placed on its back in quick succession: a red soda can (00:06-00:07), a large orange soda bottle (00:07-00:08), a clear plastic container filled with snacks (00:09-00:10), a pink Lotso bear plush toy (00:10-00:11), and finally, a white cat litter box placed upside down over its back (00:11-00:13). The cat maintains a stoic expression, looking towards the camera.
