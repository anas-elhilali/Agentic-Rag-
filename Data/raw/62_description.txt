Here's a description of the video scenes:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A person stands by a clear glass door, and a golden British Shorthair cat is seen sitting inside a bright kitchen on the other side of the glass. The cat appears sad. The view then shifts to three golden British Shorthair cats sitting on the floor, looking intently through the glass door at the single cat in the kitchen.

Scene 2 (00:03–00:06): The golden British Shorthair cat from the kitchen is shown sitting on the floor, looking grumpy or upset, with the clean kitchen visible in the background.

Scene 3 (00:06–00:10): A man steps out onto a balcony through a glass sliding door, with two golden British Shorthair cats near his feet. He re-enters the room, casually closing the glass door behind him, inadvertently leaving the two cats outside on the balcony.

Scene 4 (00:10–00:12): The two golden British Shorthair cats are seen sitting on the balcony side of the glass door, looking inside with pleading expressions.

Scene 5 (00:12–00:18): Surveillance footage shows a man opening a large white double-door refrigerator in a kitchen. A golden British Shorthair cat walks into the lower section of the open refrigerator. The man then walks away, seemingly forgetting to close the doors, leaving the cat inside.

Scene 6 (00:18–00:24): The man returns to the refrigerator and attempts to close the doors, but the cat inside starts to struggle and tries to get out. He eventually closes the doors, and the cat is trapped. The man then re-opens the door, and the cat quickly scurries out.

Scene 7 (00:24–00:26): A close-up of a golden British Shorthair cat sitting on the floor, looking down with a sad or disgruntled expression, while a hand gently pets its head.

Scene 8 (00:26–00:28): A close-up shot of the clean, empty bottom compartment inside the refrigerator.

Scene 9 (00:28–00:30): The golden British Shorthair cat from Scene 7 is shown again. A hand places a light blue bowl containing wet cat food in front of it.

Scene 10 (00:30–00:34): Three golden British Shorthair cats are sitting on the wooden floor, looking up at a closed white wardrobe.

Scene 11 (00:34–00:39): Surveillance footage shows a man opening a white wardrobe door in a bedroom. A golden British Shorthair cat quickly walks inside the wardrobe, and the man closes the door. Moments later, the man opens the door again, and the cat promptly exits.

Scene 12 (00:39–00:43): A close-up of a hand opening the white wardrobe door. A golden British Shorthair cat is discovered sitting inside the bottom of the wardrobe, looking up. Another cat is partially visible on the floor outside the wardrobe.

Scene 13 (00:43–00:45): A close-up of the golden British Shorthair cat sitting inside the wardrobe, with its eyes digitally exaggerated to be very large and round, giving it a surprised or cute appearance.
