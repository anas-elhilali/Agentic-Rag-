Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lying in a neat row on a pink striped bed, intently watching something off-screen with focused expressions.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): A white tablet on the pink striped bed displays an animated cartoon featuring a cat and a mouse, revealing what the cats were watching.
Scene 3 (00:03–00:04): A human hand reaches into the frame and turns off the screen of the tablet, making it black.
Scene 4 (00:04–00:06): The four golden British Shorthair cats look up with wide, questioning eyes and confused expressions, as if wondering why their show was turned off.
Scene 5 (00:06–00:07): The camera pans to reveal a small open notebook and a pen placed on the pink striped bed next to the cats.
Scene 6 (00:07–00:10): The four golden British Shorthair cats are now facing away from the camera, huddled around the open notebook and pen, with several educational books neatly lined up behind them on the bed, giving the impression they are diligently studying.
