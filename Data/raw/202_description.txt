Scene 5 (00:12–00:16): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on a gray couch, observing two other golden British Shorthair cats on the same couch, one of which is wearing a yellow cloth. The observing cat then moves closer to one of the other cats.
Scene 6 (00:16–00:20): Two golden British Shorthair cats are face-to-face on the couch. One cat swats the face of the other cat with its paw, while its mouth is wide open as if yelling or roaring.

Scene 9 (00:26–00:28): A human hand uses a green spoon to scoop wet cat food from a can into a blue cat bowl. The golden British Shorthair cat is positioned beside the bowl, observing the food preparation. A small decorated Christmas tree is in the background.
Scene 10 (00:28–00:32): From a top-down view, a golden British Shorthair cat is eagerly eating from the blue cat bowl on a wooden floor. Another golden British Shorthair cat then approaches the bowl from the right, showing interest in the food.
Scene 11 (00:32–00:36): Two golden British Shorthair cats are at the blue food bowl, both attempting to eat. The cat that was initially eating looks up with an annoyed or frustrated expression as the other cat continues to eat, while a third cat is briefly visible observing from a distance.
