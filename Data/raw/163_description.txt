Here's a detailed description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A golden British Shorthair cat is comfortably resting on a hamburger-shaped pet bed. A hand places a stack of red envelopes in front of the cat, and the cat lifts its head, looking curious.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:09): Hands are shown meticulously crafting a red, hexagonal lantern using red envelopes. The process involves cutting, inserting small wooden sticks, and securing them, with the cat observing from its bed in the background.
Scene 3 (00:09–00:10): The completed red lantern, shaped like a hexagon, is displayed on a checkered mat, with the cat still visible in the background.
Scene 4 (00:10–00:12): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lying in a neat row on a white sofa. Below them, three larger red lanterns and one much smaller lantern are arranged on the mat.
Scene 5 (00:12–00:13): A hand dangles one of the larger red lanterns in front of the four cats, holding it by a wooden stick.
Scene 6 (00:13–00:15): A close-up on two of the cats. A hand holds the smallest red lantern on a stick, presenting it to the second cat from the right, which has bright green eyes and looks unhappy.
Scene 7 (00:15–00:17): The cat with green eyes looks down at the small lantern, then quickly bats the stick away with its paw, showing its displeasure.
Scene 8 (00:17–00:20): The cat turns its head away from the small lantern, still appearing sullen, as the hand tries to bring the lantern closer again.
