Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A person in a white jacket and black pants walks past a white sofa where four golden British Shorthair cats are neatly lined up in loaf positions.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:05): The person sits down on the white sofa next to the four cat loaves, appearing to be engrossed in their phone, occasionally looking at or gently petting one of the cats.
Scene 3 (00:05–00:08): The scene transitions to show the person and the four cats transformed into skeletons on the sofa, with one small cat skull having rolled onto the floor.
