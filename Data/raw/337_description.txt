Here is a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:00): A hand holds a small, flat, yellow, cartoon cat cutout, seen from behind, over a wooden floor.
Scene 2 (00:00–00:04): On a wooden floor, a person's hands operate a device, causing a small yellow cat cutout to spin rapidly in place.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:08): A golden British Shorthair cat suddenly appears on the wooden floor, looking up intently with wide, bright green eyes. A hand is seen resting on its back, and then its ears flatten slightly in response to something off-screen.
