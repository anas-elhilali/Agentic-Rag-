Scene 4 (00:09–00:18): Close-up of a golden British Shorthair cat resting on a checkered cat bed. A human hand presents a small box to the cat, which looks at the box and then up at the camera with wide, expressive eyes. Another golden cat is visible in the background.
Scene 5 (00:18–00:25): Monochromatic view of the bedroom at night. A person is lying awake in bed, looking restless and unable to sleep. Four cats are sound asleep around the bed, some in their checkered beds, with animated "Z" symbols indicating snoring.
