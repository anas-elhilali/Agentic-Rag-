Here's a description of the video, formatted as requested:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A golden British Shorthair cat lies on the wooden floor. A grey and black tabby cat approaches it from behind and appears to 'mount' it briefly.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:02): The golden cat turns its head to look at the tabby cat, which is still partially on its back.
Scene 3 (00:02–00:04): The tabby cat sits upright while the golden cat lies in front, licking its paw.
Scene 4 (00:04–00:07): On a white rug, the tabby cat suddenly kicks up a cloud of dust or powder, looking as though it's "exploding" or vanishing, while a smaller golden cat watches from a distance. A human hand reaches towards the dissipating cloud.
Scene 5 (00:07–00:08): A hand attempts to put a cat into a grey mesh pet carrier, but the cat is mostly obscured.
Scene 6 (00:08–00:10): The hand unzips the mesh opening of the carrier, revealing a golden British Shorthair cat sitting calmly inside.
Scene 7 (00:10–00:13): Close-up on the golden cat's face inside the carrier, looking a bit confused but calm.
Scene 8 (00:13–00:15): The golden cat looks wide-eyed, its pupils comically enlarged.
Scene 9 (00:15–00:20): Security camera footage shows a living room from above. Two golden British Shorthair cats are near a sofa on the left. A pet carrier is on the right. One golden cat quickly crawls out of the carrier and runs away. Immediately after, another golden cat cautiously approaches the empty carrier and enters it.
Scene 10 (00:20–00:22): Close-up on the golden cat inside the pet carrier at what appears to be a veterinary clinic. Its back is to the camera as a hand gently pets it. The cat looks unhappy.
Scene 11 (00:22–00:25): An operating room. The golden cat is lying on its back on an operating table, stomach shaved and prepped for surgery under bright lights.
Scene 12 (00:25–00:29): Close-up of the golden cat, looking groggy and semi-conscious with its tongue partially out, lying on a metallic surface, possibly recovering from anesthesia. A human hand gently strokes its head.
Scene 13 (00:29–00:32): The golden cat, now wearing a floral-patterned cone collar, sits on a white examination mat at the clinic. A person's hand pets its head.
Scene 14 (00:32–00:34): A male veterinarian gently holds the golden cat's paw. The cat appears slightly resistant.
Scene 15 (00:34–00:38): Extreme close-up of the golden cat's face, licking its paw, looking slightly annoyed, while being held by a human.
Scene 16 (00:38–00:41): The golden cat, wearing the floral cone, sits on a wooden floor at home, looking at its reflection in a tall, ornate floor-length mirror.
Scene 17 (00:41–00:44): The golden cat, still wearing the cone, sits on a grey dining chair, looking downwards. A "Honorary Certificate" is placed on the table next to it.
Scene 18 (00:44–00:45): Close-up of the golden cat on the chair, its mouth open in a distressed meow, looking angry.
Scene 19 (00:45–00:48): Another golden cat (the one that escaped spaying) approaches the spayed golden cat, who is resting in a wooden pet bed with the floral cone. The spayed cat glares and lets out an angry meow.
Scene 20 (00:48–00:49): Close-up of the spayed golden cat's face, eyes closed in what looks like frustration or pain, mouth still open as if meowing.
