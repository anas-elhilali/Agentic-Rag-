Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A person wearing a brown jacket pets four golden British Shorthair cats lying in a perfect row on a light blue bed. The cats are facing the camera. The person then stands up and walks away from the bed, out of frame.

Scene 2 (00:03–00:09): The four golden British Shorthair cats remain lying in a perfect row on the light blue bed, looking attentively in the direction the person left.

Scene 3 (00:09–00:15): The four golden British Shorthair cats subtly inch forward together in their perfect line on the bed, maintaining their formation. One of the cats yawns.
