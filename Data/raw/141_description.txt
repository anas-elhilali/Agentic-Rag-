Scene 4 (00:04–00:06): A first-person view shows a person's bare feet with torn white socks on a white carpet, followed by five golden British Shorthair cats (including adult and kitten sizes) sitting in a line on the carpet, looking towards the camera.

Scene 5 (00:08–00:09): A person measures their bare foot with a yellow tape measure on a white carpet, while a golden British Shorthair cat lies beside the foot, watching.

Scene 6 (00:09–00:12): Two golden British Shorthair cats lie on a white mat on a table. A person's hand draws slipper outlines on white paper in front of them, then spreads a large amount of golden cat fur onto the drawn shapes.

Scene 7 (00:12–00:16): A person's hand repeatedly pets the heads of the two golden British Shorthair cats on the mat, appearing to collect more fur. Both cats look somewhat displeased.

Scene 8 (00:16–00:21): The person uses a yellow sponge to rub soapy water onto the fur-covered slipper shapes. The completed, large, golden fuzzy slippers are then placed in front of the cats. One cat looks at the large slippers with a surprised expression.

Scene 9 (00:22–00:27): A close-up shows a person's hand reaching towards a golden British Shorthair cat on the mat. The cat repeatedly retracts its paw, and then both cats turn their backs to the camera, appearing sulky.

The scene transitions to the person sitting on the carpet, their feet in the slippers, as two golden British Shorthair cats lie nearby, looking at the slippers with seemingly unimpressed expressions.
