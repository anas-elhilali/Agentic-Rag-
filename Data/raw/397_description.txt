Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A wide shot of a bedroom shows a large bed covered with a pink duvet. Nine cats of various breeds, including golden British Shorthairs and a bicolor Ragdoll, are spread out and relaxing on the bed, occupying most of the space.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): The camera pans down to reveal a person sleeping on a mat on the floor next to the bed, covered by a light green blanket. The cats are still on the bed in the background.
Scene 3 (00:03–00:05): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up neatly on a wooden floor, sitting upright and looking intently towards the camera, positioned next to a white radiator.
Scene 4 (00:05–00:07): A yellow, square-patterned bamboo mat is being spread across the bed. An inset video simultaneously plays, showing an American Shorthair cat carefully pawing at a similar bamboo mat.
Scene 5 (00:07–00:09): Four golden British Shorthair cats are gathered on the newly laid bamboo mat. Two cats in the foreground are close together, appearing to interact, while two others are further back on the bed.

Scene 8 (00:13–00:15): A golden British Shorthair cat attempts to lie down on the bamboo mat but swiftly lifts itself back up, shaking its paws as if the mat is causing discomfort.
Scene 9 (00:15–00:19): Another golden British Shorthair cat tries to walk on the mat, struggles, shakes its paws repeatedly, then sits down and tries to lick or clean its paw.
Scene 10 (00:19–00:21): The golden British Shorthair cat continues to struggle with the mat, moving its paws rapidly and appearing agitated before finally standing up from the mat.
Scene 11 (00:21–00:23): A lighter golden British Shorthair cat with bright green eyes sits on the bamboo mat, looking directly at the camera with its mouth slightly ajar, as if reacting to the mat's texture.

Scene 14 (00:26–00:28): The camera pans from the bed with the bamboo mat to show the four golden British Shorthair cats sitting on the wooden floor, looking up at the bed, seemingly refusing to step on the mat.

Scene 16 (00:30–00:32): The bamboo mat is lifted from the bed, revealing a significant amount of cat fur lying underneath it on the pink bedsheet. A golden British Shorthair cat is visible on the floor, looking up.
