Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:01): A man in a striped shirt leans over a white table to kiss the head of a golden British Shorthair cat, the first in a line of four identical cats.
Scene 2 (00:01-00:03): The man moves along the line, gently holding and kissing the head of the second golden British Shorthair cat.
Scene 3 (00:03-00:05): The man shifts to the third golden British Shorthair cat, holding its face and kissing its head.
Scene 4 (00:05-00:07): The man looks at the fourth and largest golden British Shorthair cat, which appears to be ignoring him, looking away.
Scene 5 (00:07-00:12): The man, unable to kiss the last cat's head, instead grabs its fluffy golden tail and proceeds to kiss the tail repeatedly, while the cat remains still and seemingly unbothered.
