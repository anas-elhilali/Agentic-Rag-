Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A human hand gently taps the head of a golden British Shorthair cat sitting on a white couch. The cat, with dark green eyes, looks up at the hand with a slightly displeased expression.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): The human hand continues to tap the cat's head. The cat slowly lowers its head, eyes half-closed, appearing increasingly upset.
Scene 3 (00:03–00:06): The cat subtly extends a paw, as if to push the hand away, but then retracts it, lowering its head further and looking dejected.
Scene 4 (00:06–00:09): The human hand gently touches the cat's curled front paw. The cat quickly pulls its paw in closer to its body, turning its head away with a visibly annoyed and sad expression.
Scene 5 (00:09–00:12): The cat curls into a tight ball, tucking its head completely into its chest, hiding its face in its paws, conveying extreme frustration or sadness.
