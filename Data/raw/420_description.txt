Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A person's hand is seen writing characters inside a clean, white toilet bowl with a black marker.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:05): A golden British Shorthair cat, sitting on a small wooden stool, intently watches as the toilet flushes and the writing inside the bowl is washed away by the swirling water.
Scene 3 (00:05–00:06): A close-up shot of the cat's face reveals a surprised or puzzled expression with wide, curious eyes.
Scene 4 (00:06–00:08): The cat observes as a human hand reaches into the toilet bowl and begins to scrub the interior while water continues to swirl.
Scene 5 (00:08–00:10): The cat maintains its gaze, showing a slightly distressed or concerned expression, as the human hand vigorously scrubs the inside of the toilet bowl.
