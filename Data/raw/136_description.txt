Here is the description of the video about cats:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): A golden British Shorthair cat lies on a light-colored rug, attentively watching a person holding a smartphone that displays a video of a woman scooping contents from a cat litter box.
Scene 2 (00:04–00:06): Four golden British Shorthair cats are arranged in a row on a light rug, all focused on a white cat litter box placed in front of them.
Scene 3 (00:06–00:08): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on a white marble table, observing as a person places a round, light-colored cake into a white cat litter box.
Scene 4 (00:08–00:10): Close-up of a person's gloved hand crumbling the cake into fine, light-colored crumbs inside the litter box.
Scene 5 (00:10–00:13): A person's gloved hand adds darker, finer crumbs to the cake crumbs in the litter box, followed by the placement of several small, dark, oblong-shaped candies (resembling cat feces) using chopsticks.
Scene 6 (00:13–00:17): A person kneels beside the prepared litter box, using a grey litter scoop to collect some of the mixture, while two golden British Shorthair cats watch intently, one with a visibly surprised expression.
Scene 7 (00:17–00:22): The person takes a bite from the scoop; one cat watches with wide, astonished eyes. The person then prepares another scoop and offers it to a different cat, who recoils with a disgusted expression.
Scene 8 (00:22–00:24): Close-up of the golden British Shorthair cat displaying a strong expression of disgust, its mouth slightly open in a grimace.
Scene 9 (00:24–00:25): A golden British Shorthair cat with white markings sits upright in front of the litter box, staring wide-eyed at its contents.
Scene 10 (00:25–00:28): Two golden British Shorthair cats walk across a wooden floor towards a balcony, and one cat enters a modern, white, covered cat house or litter box.
Scene 11 (00:28–00:30): A golden British Shorthair cat leans over the white litter box, sniffing the 'litter' mixture with a confused expression.
Scene 12 (00:30–00:34): A wide, top-down security camera view of the living room shows the person kneeling by the fake litter box. In the background, another golden British Shorthair cat is seen actively using a real automatic litter box.
Scene 13 (00:34–00:41): The person continues to scoop and eat the mixture from the fake litter box. A woman appears in the doorway in the background, observing the scene with a look of shock and disbelief.
