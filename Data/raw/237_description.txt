Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A person is lying on a white mat with their head inside an open white pet dryer, holding a phone. Three golden British Shorthair cats sit attentively beside them, observing the person and the dryer.

Scene 2 (00:03–00:06): Two of the golden British Shorthair cats have jumped onto the top of the pet dryer, peering down at the person's head inside. The third cat remains on the floor, looking up towards the dryer.

Scene 3 (00:06–00:10): From an overhead perspective, all three golden British Shorthair cats are now comfortably lying in a line on the person's body, from their chest down to their legs, as the person continues to lie with their head in the pet dryer.
