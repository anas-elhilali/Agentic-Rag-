Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A young man lies asleep on a white bed under a duvet, next to him, a golden British Shorthair cat is tucked under the covers with only its head on the pillow, appearing to be asleep and snoring.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:04): A hand gently taps the sleeping cat's head. The cat slowly opens its green eyes, looking slightly annoyed. The man remains asleep.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:06): The cat is now fully awake, looking at the hand with an expression of mild irritation, while the man continues to sleep soundly and snore.
Scene 4 (00:06–00:08): The hand taps the cat's head again, more firmly. The cat's expression shifts from annoyance to visible anger. The man is still asleep.
Scene 5 (00:08–00:10): The cat looks from the hand to the deeply sleeping man, then back to the hand, appearing confused as the snoring continues.
Scene 6 (00:10–00:12): The cat glares intently at the hand, then shifts its gaze towards the man, who is still snoring, as if questioning the source of the noise.
Scene 7 (00:12–00:17): The hand begins gently stroking and petting the cat's head. The cat's expression softens, its eyes close, and it leans into the comforting touch, seeming content.
