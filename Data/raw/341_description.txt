Here is a description of the video, formatted as requested:

Scene 1 (00:01–00:04): A computer screen in what appears to be a veterinary office displays an X-ray of a cat's abdomen, showing a large accumulation within its intestines. A black keyboard and a small pink sign are visible on the desk below the screen.

Scene 2 (00:04–00:05): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on the desk in front of the computer screen, looking up at the viewer with wide, curious eyes and a slightly confused expression.

Scene 3 (00:05–00:08): The golden British Shorthair cat is sitting on a gray bed, observing several small pink packaged items laid out in front of it. The cat then turns and quickly jumps off the bed.

Scene 4 (00:08–00:10): The golden British Shorthair cat walks across a wooden floor, heading purposefully towards a white, dome-shaped automatic litter box in the distance.

Scene 5 (00:10–00:11): The cat approaches and then enters the large, white, dome-shaped automatic litter box, which is decorated with colorful cartoon stickers.

Scene 6 (00:11–00:14): The cat is inside the litter box, appearing to struggle as it attempts to relieve itself. A human hand holds up a smartphone displaying an app with an activity log, showing "5 minutes 24 seconds."

Scene 7 (00:14–00:15): A human hand holds one of the small pink packaged items (a suppository or similar) towards the golden British Shorthair cat, who is still inside the litter box.

Scene 8 (00:15–00:20): The golden British Shorthair cat is seen from a top-down view, lying on a wooden floor or table. A human hand gently touches and pulls its fluffy tail, while another hand holds the pink packaged item. The cat displays expressions of confusion, slight annoyance, and anxiety as its tail is manipulated.

Scene 9 (00:20–00:22): The golden British Shorthair cat is on the wooden table, looking directly at the camera with comically exaggerated wide, surprised eyes. A human hand is still touching its tail, seemingly triggering this dramatic reaction.

Scene 10 (00:22–00:23): The golden British Shorthair cat quickly rushes across the wooden floor and re-enters the white automatic litter box.

Scene 11 (00:23–00:25): Inside the litter box, the golden British Shorthair cat is actively digging and covering the litter.

Scene 12 (00:25–00:27): A human hand pulls out a side compartment from the automatic litter box, revealing a waste bag inside.

Scene 13 (00:27–00:32): The golden British Shorthair cat is back inside the litter box, continuing to dig, then sits and looks at the camera with an intense expression, its eyes appearing to glow red.
