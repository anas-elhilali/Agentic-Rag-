Here is the description for the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): A person kneels in front of a white couch, holding a phone to their ear, while four golden British Shorthair cats sit neatly in a row on the couch. The person occasionally pets one of the cats.
Scene 2 (00:04–00:06): The four golden British Shorthair cats are still lined up on the white couch, now with a large fluffy ball of shed cat fur appearing next to the rightmost cat. The cats look curiously at the fur ball.
Scene 3 (00:06–00:08): A close-up shot of one golden British Shorthair cat lying down, being petted by a human hand. A significant pile of shed cat fur rests next to the cat. The cat appears somewhat resigned.
Scene 4 (00:08–00:12): The four golden British Shorthair cats are again lined up on the white couch, all looking rather grumpy. A human hand tosses the large ball of shed fur into the air in front of them.
