Here is a description of the video scenes:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A fluffy golden British Shorthair kitten is deeply asleep on a white bed with a pillow, holding onto a white baby bottle.

Scene 2 (00:03–00:09): A human hand gently attempts to pull the bottle away from the sleeping golden kitten. The kitten instinctively tightens its grip on the bottle, making a slight noise, and then the hand affectionately strokes the kitten.

Scene 3 (00:09–00:13): In a kitchen, a human hand holds a small, fluffy white kitten over a cooking pot on a stovetop before gently placing the kitten inside the pot.

Scene 4 (00:13–00:16): The white kitten is inside the pot as the human hand adds various spices, including star anise and bay leaves, around it. The hand then uses a wooden spatula to playfully "stir" the kitten within the pot.

Scene 5 (00:16–00:17): The human hand places a white lid firmly on the cooking pot, completely covering the kitten inside.

Scene 6 (00:17–00:19): The human hand lifts the lid from the pot. Instead of the white kitten, the golden British Shorthair kitten from Scene 1 is now sitting inside the pot, and an adult golden British Shorthair cat is sitting beside the stovetop, looking at the pot with curiosity.

Scene 7 (00:19–00:20): The human hand picks up the golden kitten from the pot; the kitten has its mouth wide open, appearing to cry or yelp.

Scene 8 (00:20–00:24): A person holds the golden kitten up close to their face, kissing and playfully sniffing the kitten as if it smells delicious.

Scene 9 (00:24–00:28): The adult golden British Shorthair cat carries the golden kitten by the scruff of its neck across a wooden floor, walking towards a yellow cat bed shaped like an animal.

Scene 10 (00:28–00:31): The adult cat continues carrying the golden kitten and carefully deposits it inside the yellow cat bed/carrier.

Scene 11 (00:31–00:32): A human hand holds the golden kitten up close to the camera. The kitten looks directly at the camera with wide, somewhat innocent and slightly sad eyes.
