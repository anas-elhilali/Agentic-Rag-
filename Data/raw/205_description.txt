Scene 3 (00:05–00:07): The kitten spins rapidly within the cardboard box, looking dizzy and leaning against the side as it rotates.
Scene 4 (00:07–00:08): A hand lifts the kitten out of the box; it appears dazed and slightly wobbly.
Scene 5 (00:08–00:13): The kitten stumbles and sways on a light wooden floor, shaking its head as if still dizzy.

Scene 10 (00:19–00:21): A close-up shows the cat's head appearing too large for the cramped space inside the box; it looks up with an unamused expression.
Scene 11 (00:21–00:23): The cat is seen on the wooden floor, stretching and shaking its head, seemingly recovering from being in the confined space.
Scene 12 (00:23–00:25): The cat walks around the wooden floor, occasionally shaking its head and appearing slightly disoriented.
