Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): Three fluffy golden British Shorthair cats sit in a row on a light wooden floor, initially looking down at a person's feet wearing realistic cat-paw patterned socks, then raising their heads to look at the camera.
Scene 2 (00:03–00:06): The camera shows a wider view of the same three golden British Shorthair cats sitting attentively in front of the person's cat-paw socks on the floor. One cat leans forward to sniff the socks.
Scene 3 (00:06–00:09): A close-up overhead shot shows the three golden British Shorthair cats actively sniffing and nuzzling the person's feet, specifically the cat-paw patterned socks, appearing very curious about them.
