Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): A group of British Shorthair cats, including golden and black tabby felines, gather around a white coffee table with a bowl of noodles on it. One golden cat repeatedly paws at the table, attempting to reach the food, while others observe intently. Another fluffy white cat is seen lying on the rug in the background.
Scene 2 (00:04–00:06): A golden British Shorthair cat observes a hand presenting a cardboard cutout of a lizard.
Scene 3 (00:06–00:08): A hand sticks the cardboard lizard onto a white wall.
Scene 4 (00:08–00:14): Two golden British Shorthair cats stand on their hind legs, stretching to bat at the cardboard lizard stuck high on the wall. Then, four golden cats are seen sitting on the floor, looking directly upwards, fixated on the lizard.
Scene 5 (00:14–00:21): Five cats, including four golden British Shorthairs and one black tabby, sit in a row against a white wall, all staring intently upwards at the cardboard lizard. A fluffy white and brown cat sits in the foreground, also looking up at the lizard.
