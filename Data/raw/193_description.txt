Here's a description of the video, formatted as requested:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): Three tiny, light brown kittens are lined up on a white plush surface in front of a window with green trees outside. Each kitten has a blue "Pepsi" label wrapped around its body, and a blue bottle cap is placed in front of each. A hand is visible on the left, near the first kitten.

Scene 2 (00:02–00:05): The same three cats, now fully grown golden British Shorthairs, are sitting in a perfectly aligned row on the white plush surface. Their paws are neatly tucked, and they gaze forward and then look around. The trees outside the window now have vibrant yellow leaves.

Scene 3 (00:05–00:09): A close-up shot focuses on one of the adult golden British Shorthair cats. The cat is sitting upright, intently watching a human finger wiggle above its head. The cat's expression shifts from curious to slightly annoyed as it looks up, then to the side, and finally directly at the camera with a subtle glare.
