Here is a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A person's hand holds a small, dark brown, heart-shaped object covered in white and brown sprinkles, resembling cat feces, against a blurred background of a living room with cat furniture.

Scene 2 (00:01–00:05): The person's hand places the brown object on a light wooden floor, near a golden British Shorthair cat resting on a yellow cat bed.

Scene 3 (00:05–00:08): The golden British Shorthair cat, still on the yellow bed, looks directly at the camera with wide, curious eyes.

Scene 4 (00:08–00:09): The golden British Shorthair cat leans forward to sniff the brown object on the floor.

Scene 5 (00:09–00:11): The golden British Shorthair cat sits upright on the bed, looking at the object with a seemingly confused or annoyed expression.

Scene 6 (00:11–00:15): The golden British Shorthair cat stretches its front paws towards the object on the floor and repeatedly paws at the floor around it, as if trying to bury it.

Scene 7 (00:15–00:20): The person's hand brings the brown object towards a golden British Shorthair cat sitting inside a yellow cone-shaped cat house. The cat sniffs the object, and the hand places it on the floor inside the cat house.

Scene 8 (00:20–00:21): The golden British Shorthair cat in the yellow cat house looks up directly at the camera with large, innocent eyes.

Scene 9 (00:21–00:25): The person's hand places the brown object on the wooden floor again, and a fluffy white and brown Ragdoll cat approaches it, sniffing.

Scene 10 (00:25–00:30): The Ragdoll cat sniffs the object intensely, then repeatedly attempts to 'bury' it by pawing the floor around it.

Scene 11 (00:30–00:31): The Ragdoll cat looks up directly at the camera with a startled expression.

Scene 12 (00:31–00:33): The person's hand offers the brown object to the golden British Shorthair cat in the yellow cat house, and the cat quickly bats it away with its paw.

Scene 13 (00:33–00:39): The person's hand places the brown object on the wooden floor in front of a black and grey tabby cat. The tabby cat sniffs the object, then picks it up with its mouth, tastes it, and immediately recoils with a look of intense disgust.

Scene 14 (00:39–00:41): A black and white, blurry shot shows the tabby cat recoiling from the object.
