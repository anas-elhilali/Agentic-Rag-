Scene 3 (00:07–00:09): A close-up of the golden British Shorthair cat, looking down with a sad expression, as a white straw is offered to its mouth by a human hand, which the cat appears to ignore or refuse.
Scene 4 (00:09–00:11): The golden British Shorthair cat is seen happily drinking from a blue carton with a straw, positioned inside a cardboard box or trash bin on a wooden floor.
Scene 5 (00:14–00:18): A golden British Shorthair cat is on a gray sofa, turning its back and walking away as a human hand presents a gray square cat toy in front of it.
Scene 6 (00:18–00:23): On a light wooden floor, the golden British Shorthair cat sits near the gray square cat toy, observed by a Ragdoll cat in the background. A white feather toy pops out of the toy, surprising the golden cat, which then actively engages with it, batting at the feather.
Scene 7 (00:24–00:28): From a top-down view, the golden British Shorthair cat and the Ragdoll cat are both on the wooden floor, engrossed in playing with the gray square cat toy.
