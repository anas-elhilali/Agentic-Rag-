Scene 19 (00:31–00:34): The golden British Shorthair cat exits the litter box, turns, and then sits down next to the small, round object it just deposited on the mat.
Scene 20 (00:34–00:37): The golden British Shorthair cat sits on the gray mat next to the litter box, looking at the small object (now with a poop emoji overlaid) and then stares directly at the camera with a resigned expression.
