Scene 1 (00:00-00:02): A golden British Shorthair cat is positioned on a grey bedspread, sitting upright behind a silver laptop. A small, rectangular silver device resembling a mini-laptop is placed directly in front of the cat. The cat looks intently towards the camera, with several books visible around it on the bed.
Scene 2 (00:02-00:04): The camera slightly pans to the right, showing the same golden British Shorthair cat looking at the small silver device. The cat is alert, with books scattered on the bed. A window with outdoor greenery is visible in the background.
Scene 3 (00:04-00:05): Three golden British Shorthair cats are neatly lined up horizontally on the grey bedspread. From left to right, each cat has a different sized silver electronic device in front of it: a full-sized laptop, a medium-sized tablet-like device, and a tiny mini-laptop. All three cats are looking forward.
Scene 4 (00:05-00:06): Three golden British Shorthair cats are arranged vertically on the bed. Each cat is accompanied by an electronic device and several books. The cat furthest away has a laptop, the middle cat has a medium-sized device, and the cat closest to the camera has a tiny device. They all face forward.
Scene 5 (00:06-00:08): Two golden British Shorthair cats are on the bed. The one on the left is positioned with a tiny silver device in front of it, surrounded by books. The cat on the right is also with a tiny silver device and books. Both are looking towards the camera.
Scene 6 (00:08-00:11): The camera slowly pans across the bed, revealing three golden British Shorthair cats. The cat on the left is partially obscured by a laptop and books. The middle cat is clearly visible with a small silver device and books. The cat on the right, positioned closer to the camera, is lying down with books, looking forward with a visibly grumpy expression.
