Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): Close-up of a golden British Shorthair cat draped in a white cape, looking curious as hands adjust the cape around its neck.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:06): The cat's expression shifts from slight frown to concerned as a comb is placed on its head and small scissors are brought near its fur, simulating a haircut.
Scene 3 (00:06–00:07): The cat suddenly ducks its head down, burying its face into the white cape, with the scissors visibly fallen onto the fabric.
Scene 4 (00:07–00:13): The cat is seen sitting on a beige couch, wearing a white bandage-like head wrap with a red mark, looking sad and dejected as it slowly lowers its head.
