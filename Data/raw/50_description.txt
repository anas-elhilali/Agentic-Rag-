Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:05): Four golden British Shorthair cats are neatly lined up in a loaf position on a gray sofa. In the foreground, on a round wooden coffee table, a human hand spins a small, food-skewer-like spinner on a red box with a hand-drawn spinner wheel. The cats watch the spinning object with interest.
Scene 2 (00:05–00:09): The spinner has stopped, pointing towards one of the cats. The four golden British Shorthair cats remain on the gray sofa, now displaying sad or resigned expressions. A human hand picks up a blue, old-fashioned-looking book from the coffee table next to the spinner box.
