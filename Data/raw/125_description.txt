Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): Three golden British Shorthair cats are sitting side-by-side on a grey couch, with large cat-face pillows behind them. A person's hands are on a laptop keyboard in the foreground. The person wiggles a toy on a string in front of the cats, who look forward without reacting, and then the person resumes typing on the laptop.

Scene 2 (00:04–00:06): A golden British Shorthair cat is sitting next to an open laptop. The cat places its paw on the laptop keyboard and looks towards the camera.

Scene 3 (00:06–00:09): The golden British Shorthair cat walks across the keyboard and then the screen of the laptop, partially obscuring the game interface displayed on the screen.

Scene 4 (00:09–00:13): The cat is looking at the laptop screen, which now displays severe colorful vertical and horizontal glitches. A hand enters the frame and gently pets the cat's head.

Scene 5 (00:13–00:17): Four golden British Shorthair cats are sitting on a grey couch. Three of the cats wear elaborate, colorful costumes (one with a blue and green hat, one in a red and gold outfit, and one in a white, red, and orange lion dance-like costume). The fourth cat on the right wears a simpler yellow and blue costume.

Scene 6 (00:17–00:20): Three of the costumed cats are now lying down on the grey couch. The cats (wearing the blue/green hat, red/gold, and white/orange lion dance costumes) appear to be resting.

Scene 7 (00:20–00:23): A grey laptop is positioned on the grey couch, displaying an animated scene from Tom and Jerry on its screen.

Scene 8 (00:23–00:24): A close-up shot of a laptop screen showing severe colorful vertical and horizontal glitches. A hand is seen touching the glitched screen.

Scene 9 (00:24–00:28): A golden British Shorthair cat, wearing a yellow and blue costume, is lying on a black laptop mat next to an open grey laptop on a couch. A hand slides the laptop closer to the cat. The cat looks forward, then briefly looks towards the camera.
