Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): Two golden British Shorthair cats are on a bed, sniffing and rubbing their heads against a person's dark hair while the person lies down.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:04): A close-up shows a small bald spot on a person's scalp, with a cat's head visible nearby.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:06): A person sits on the floor with three golden British Shorthair cats on their lap, using a thin stick to apply something to one of the cat's heads from a bowl.
Scene 4 (00:06–00:07): Three cats (a black and white tabby, a long-haired bi-color, and a golden British Shorthair) are lined up on a wooden floor, looking up expectantly at an empty three-bowl feeder.
Scene 5 (00:07–00:09): A person's hand pours dry food into a feeder bowl while a golden British Shorthair cat eats eagerly from an adjacent bowl.
Scene 6 (00:09–00:11): Three cats are on a grey sofa; a golden British Shorthair sits glumly in the middle while another golden British Shorthair and a black and white tabby sniff its head from either side.
Scene 7 (00:11–00:12): A close-up of the grumpy golden British Shorthair cat from the previous scene, being sniffed by two other cats.
Scene 8 (00:12–00:15): A golden British Shorthair cat lies on a grey sofa with a very grumpy expression while another golden British Shorthair cat and a long-haired bi-color cat vigorously lick its head.
Scene 9 (00:15–00:19): Three golden British Shorthair cats sit side-by-side on a grey sofa. Their fur on top of their heads is wet and spiky, indicating they've been recently groomed or bathed, and they all appear disgruntled.
