Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A pile of numerous cotton swabs with white tips and golden sticks is scattered across a light grey wooden floor. A golden cat's paw is briefly visible at the top, just entering the frame.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:04): A golden British Shorthair cat, lying on its belly, observes the scattered cotton swabs on the floor. It looks over its shoulder with an expression of curiosity or slight bewilderment.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:06): The golden British Shorthair cat slightly shifts its position, still lying down and looking towards the scattered cotton swabs, appearing to ponder them.
Scene 4 (00:06–00:11): The golden British Shorthair cat rolls onto its side, extends a paw, and playfully bats at the cotton swabs, actively engaging with them on the floor.
