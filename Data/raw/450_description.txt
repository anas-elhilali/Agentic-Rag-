Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A golden British Shorthair cat lies on its back on a soft white fluffy blanket, its paws curled up. A human hand gently pats the cat's head, but the cat remains completely still and unresponsive.

Scene 2 (00:03–00:05): The cat is seen sitting upright on a media console in a living room, completely engrossed in watching an animated show featuring a cat and a fish on a large television screen. The scene then briefly cuts back to the cat lying on the blanket.

Scene 3 (00:05–00:09): The golden British Shorthair cat is again shown lying on its back on the white blanket, appearing very relaxed. The human hand repeatedly pokes the cat's head, but it continues to show no reaction, remaining still.

Scene 4 (00:09–00:10): Abruptly, the cat springs up from its relaxed position, quickly turning its head towards the human hand and letting out a distinct meow.
