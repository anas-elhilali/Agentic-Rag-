Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): A group of several golden British Shorthair cats, possibly kittens, are cozily snuggled together under a light pink duvet on a bed. They are attentively watching an animated cartoon playing on an iPad propped up on a pillow beside them. A plush bunny and a blue Stitch toy are visible on a bedside table in the background.
Scene 2 (00:04–00:09): The camera pans to a large window, revealing it decorated with multiple green soda cans that have paper wings taped to them, giving the whimsical appearance of little flying objects stuck to the glass.
