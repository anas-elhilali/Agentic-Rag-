Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A hand pulls back a blue blanket on a bed, revealing four golden British Shorthair cats lying in a row under the covers. They then simultaneously turn their heads towards the camera.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:07): A person's hand gestures towards a white circular electric heater on the bed. The four golden British Shorthair cats are now lined up, lying in front of the heater on the blue bedsheet, appearing to warm themselves.
Scene 3 (00:07–00:11): One golden British Shorthair cat lies on a brown and white checkered mat, its back to a glowing electric heater, with steam or mist appearing to rise from its fur. Then, four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up with their backs to the heater on the mat, warming themselves.
Scene 4 (00:11–00:16): A hand pets one of the golden British Shorthair cats on the checkered mat. The cat initially looks content, then its facial fur appears singed or frizzy, and it gives a displeased look.
Scene 5 (00:16–00:19): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lying in a disgruntled row on the bed. A hand gently pats the back of one of the cats.
Scene 6 (00:19–00:23): A hand tries to touch a golden British Shorthair cat on the bed. The cat quickly swats at the hand, then turns its head away, looking annoyed.
Scene 7 (00:23–00:26): Golden cat hair is scattered on the light blue bedsheet. A handheld vacuum cleaner is used to clean up the hair.
Scene 8 (00:26–00:28): Three golden British Shorthair cats are lying comfortably in a row on the freshly cleaned bed.
Scene 9 (00:28–00:35): In black and white night vision, a person is seen sleeping under spike mats on a bed. Four light-colored cats are perched on the headboard, observing. One cat jumps onto the spike mat but quickly recoils. The footage briefly glitches.
