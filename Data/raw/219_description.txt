Here is a description of the video, structured to help a script-generating model:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A hand holds a small, light golden British Shorthair kitten by its armpits, dangling it over a large, light green litter box filled with white litter.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:05): A person’s face is close to a small, fluffy white kitten, gently kissing its paw. The kitten is held in the person's hands.
Scene 3 (00:05–00:07): Two hands place three tiny kittens—two white and one golden British Shorthair—onto a white fluffy mat inside the light green litter box.
Scene 4 (00:07–00:08): A light golden British Shorthair kitten stands alone in the vast light green litter box, looking around.
Scene 5 (00:08–00:10): A white kitten is sitting and meowing inside the spacious litter box, appearing very small.
Scene 6 (00:10–00:11): The light golden British Shorthair kitten is shown again, looking small and seemingly overwhelmed in the large litter box.
Scene 7 (00:11–00:13): Two white kittens are inside the litter box, observing a hand placing a small, brown piece (resembling cat waste) onto the white litter in front of them.
Scene 8 (00:13–00:15): One of the white kittens instinctively starts digging and burying the brown piece with its paws in the litter.
Scene 9 (00:15–00:16): The white kitten sits up after successfully burying the piece, looking content.
Scene 10 (00:16–00:18): The light golden kitten stands in the litter box, looking up at an adult golden British Shorthair cat peering into the box from above.
Scene 11 (00:18–00:21): The adult golden British Shorthair cat is now inside the litter box, actively demonstrating digging in the litter, while the small light golden kitten watches.
Scene 12 (00:21–00:22): A close-up shows the light golden kitten clumsily attempting to dig in the litter, appearing a bit confused.
Scene 13 (00:22–00:23): The light golden kitten stands on the white fluffy mat next to the litter box. A hand reaches down to pick it up.
Scene 14 (00:23–00:27): The light golden kitten is held up, its face coated with white litter particles, and it appears distressed, possibly crying.
Scene 15 (00:27–00:29): A wide shot shows the light golden kitten curled up and sleeping soundly on its side inside the large light green litter box.
Scene 16 (00:29–00:34): A close-up of the light golden kitten sleeping deeply on its back inside the litter box, with its paws curled up. A hand gently pokes its belly, but the kitten remains asleep.
