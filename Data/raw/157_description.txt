Here is a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up neatly on a light grey bed, facing a tablet propped up on a pillow. They are all looking intently towards the tablet.

Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): The camera shifts, showing the four golden British Shorthair cats engrossed in watching a cartoon on the tablet, their gazes fixed on the screen.

Scene 3 (00:03–00:06): A person's hand reaches into the frame and taps the screen of the tablet, while the four cats remain focused on the cartoon.

Scene 4 (00:06–00:09): The cats are shown looking up, and a person's hand with an extended index finger points towards them. The cats appear with a curious or slightly confused expression.
