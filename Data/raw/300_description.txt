Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): Four golden British Shorthair cats are neatly lined up on a white sofa, attentively watching a person's hand. The hand first presents three large red envelopes, placing them in front of the first three cats. Subsequently, a much smaller, fourth red envelope is presented and placed in front of the last cat.
Scene 2 (00:03–00:04): A top-down view shows the four cats and their respective red envelopes. The three larger envelopes each have a dried fish on top, while the smallest envelope in front of the fourth cat has a tiny key on it. The fourth cat looks at its envelope.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:08): The scene focuses on the fourth cat and its small red envelope. The cat is watching the tiny key. A human hand gently taps the cat's paw, and the cat retracts it. The key on the envelope is suddenly replaced by a dried fish. The hand taps the cat's paw two more times, and the cat continues to withdraw its paw, appearing increasingly upset and displeased.
