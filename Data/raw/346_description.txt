Here is a detailed description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A person wearing a large golden cat head mask and fluffy golden cat paw gloves kneels on a light wooden floor, facing three golden British Shorthair cats. Another golden British Shorthair cat is near the person's left, and a white Ragdoll cat is visible in the background on a yellow couch. The cats appear curious and watchful.

Scene 2 (00:02–00:04): A hand holds up two pairs of knee-high socks patterned like cat paws and fur – one grey tabby and one orange tabby. In the background, a large, multi-tiered cat tree with brown and green platforms is visible.

Scene 3 (00:04–00:07): Three golden British Shorthair cats sit side-by-side on the wooden floor, looking down intently at a person's feet, which are now clad in the orange tabby-patterned socks. The cats tilt their heads slightly, appearing confused.

Scene 4 (00:07–00:10): A black and grey striped tabby cat (possibly an American Shorthair or British Shorthair) sits on the wooden floor, looking down at a person's feet, which are wearing the grey tabby-patterned socks. The cat then looks up at the camera with wide, surprised eyes.

Scene 5 (00:10–00:14): The three golden British Shorthair cats are again sitting in a line on the wooden floor. A hand holds two ultrasound images, showing what appear to be cat fetuses, in front of the cats. The cats look at the images with perplexed expressions.

Scene 6 (00:14–00:19): A person sits on a checkered cushion on the floor, holding and patting a very large, round "pregnant" belly (likely a prop or pillow). The three golden British Shorthair cats are in front of the person, looking at the belly with expressions of disbelief and confusion.

Scene 7 (00:19–00:24): Two golden British Shorthair cats are eating kibble from light blue, fish-shaped bowls on the wooden floor. A person kneels beside them and picks up some kibble, pretending to eat it from their hand. The cats stop eating and stare at the person with wide-eyed shock and apparent disgust.

Scene 8 (00:24–00:31): A golden British Shorthair cat is lying on a white round table. A hand gently strokes the cat's head. The hand then presents a smartphone displaying a "pet affinity test" application, showing a "99% affinity" result. The cat looks intently at the phone screen, then turns its head to gaze directly at the camera with very large, surprised eyes.

Scene 9 (00:31–00:35): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on a white round table. A hand holds up a small clump of golden cat fur, which appears to have been brushed or pulled from the cat. The cat looks up at the hand, then closes its eyes as if annoyed or displeased.

Scene 10 (00:35–00:38): A golden British Shorthair cat walks onto a light beige rug and rubs its face affectionately against a person's hand. The cat then rolls onto its back, purring, showing extreme closeness and attachment to the person.

Scene 11 (00:38–00:46): A golden British Shorthair cat walks across the light beige rug, then lies down and turns its head to look directly at the camera with wide, innocent, and curious eyes.
