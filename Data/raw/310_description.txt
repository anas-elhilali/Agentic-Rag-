Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A person's hand holds a small, light orange kitten wrapped in a light brown tortilla-like material, with only its head visible, looking forward.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): Two hands gently hold the small golden kitten above a wooden board, with lettuce and other items on a white table.
Scene 3 (00:03–00:05): The kitten sits on a wooden board as a hand places a white spring onion and a brown strip next to it.
Scene 4 (00:05–00:07): A hand places a large green lettuce leaf on the kitten's head, which is still sitting on the wooden board.
Scene 5 (00:07–00:08): Hands begin to wrap the kitten, which has a lettuce leaf on its head, into the brown tortilla-like material on the wooden board.
Scene 6 (00:08–00:09): A person holds the fully wrapped kitten with the lettuce "hat"; the kitten opens its mouth as if meowing loudly.
Scene 7 (00:09–00:13): A large golden British Shorthair cat approaches as a person holds the wrapped, meowing kitten; the person then jokingly pretends to bite the kitten while the adult cat observes.
