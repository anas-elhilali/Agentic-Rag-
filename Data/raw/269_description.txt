Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A person holds a golden British Shorthair cat and walks towards an open bathroom door, where three identical golden British Shorthair cats are sitting in a neat line, looking attentively at the bathroom. The person enters the bathroom with the cat.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:05): The person is sitting on the toilet inside the bathroom, holding the cat on their lap and looking at their phone. The three golden cats remain seated in a line outside the bathroom, seemingly waiting patiently.
Scene 3 (00:06–00:08): The scene comically transforms. A human skeleton is now seated on the toilet inside the bathroom, while two cat skeletons are positioned on the floor outside, where the live cats were previously waiting.
