Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A golden British Shorthair cat with green eyes is resting in a loaf position on a white sofa. Its eyes are closed as a human hand gently pets the top of its head.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:04): The hand continues to pet the cat's head and ears. The cat slowly opens its eyes, looks up with a slightly annoyed expression, then glances towards the right.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:05): The cat closes its eyes again, lowering its head. The hand withdraws.
Scene 4 (00:05–00:06): The cat shifts slightly, looking down and away, appearing to be in a huff. A hand briefly attempts to reach for it from the right side of the frame but retreats.
Scene 5 (00:06–00:11): The cat remains in a "loaf" position on the sofa, with its eyes closed and head lowered, appearing to be sulking or ignoring its surroundings.
