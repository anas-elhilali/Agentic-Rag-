Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:05): A person is holding a small, fluffy golden-colored kitten, likely a British Shorthair, with both hands. The kitten is held close to the person's face, who appears to be playfully sniffing or nuzzling the kitten. The kitten's tiny paws are visible, and it looks directly at the camera at first, then away as it's brought closer to the person's face. A cat tree is visible in the background.

Scene 2 (00:05-00:10): A close-up shot of the same fluffy golden-colored kitten being held up. The kitten's mouth is wide open, as if it's loudly meowing or expressing distress. Its eyes are slightly squinted, conveying an exaggerated expression.
