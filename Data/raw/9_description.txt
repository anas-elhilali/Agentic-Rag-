Here's the description for the video:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:02): A person sits at a dining table, eating. Behind them, a golden British Shorthair cat is seen through a glass kitchen door, first sitting, then standing on its hind legs, seemingly trying to get attention or exit.
Scene 2 (00:02-00:04): The cat sits on the kitchen floor near the closed glass door, looking out with a seemingly annoyed or frustrated expression, while the person continues eating in the foreground.
Scene 3 (00:04-00:09): A person walks over to the kitchen's sliding glass door and demonstrates leaving a small gap by pulling one panel slightly to the side. The cat is visible inside the kitchen.
Scene 4 (00:09-00:12): The cat walks around inside the kitchen near the partially open glass door, sniffing the floor, but does not attempt to use the visible gap to exit.
Scene 5 (00:12-00:15): The cat tries to open the glass door by pushing on a solid glass panel with its paws and nose, then stands on its hind legs to paw at the door, completely ignoring the open gap. A second cat briefly appears outside the door.
Scene 6 (00:15-00:18): The cat continues to wander aimlessly near the glass door inside the kitchen, looking confused and frustrated, without attempting to use the small opening.
Scene 7 (00:18-00:22): A person's hand points to the small gap in the glass door from the outside, showing the cat where it can exit. The cat sits inside, looking at the person, but doesn't react or attempt to go through the gap.
Scene 8 (00:22-00:25): A close-up shows the cat sitting inside the kitchen with a visibly annoyed or angry expression, looking directly at the camera.
Scene 9 (00:25-00:31): Three small golden British Shorthair kittens sit on the floor outside the kitchen door, observing the trapped cat inside. The cat inside looks frustrated and confused, shifting its gaze, still unable to figure out how to exit through the open gap.
