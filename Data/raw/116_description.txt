Here's a description of the video, broken down by scenes with timestamps:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A person's hand uses a calligraphy brush to write the Chinese character "福" (fú) in black ink on a red paper adorned with gold patterns.

Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): Three golden British Shorthair cats sit in a row on a wooden floor, attentively watching as a person holds up a completed red calligraphy paper featuring the character "福." A red and white cat house is in the background.

Scene 3 (00:03–00:05): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up on the wooden floor, observing a person holding a calligraphy brush over a blank red paper, ready to write.

Scene 4 (00:05–00:06): A close-up shot shows a golden British Shorthair cat lying on its back, its paw being gently held by a person's hand, revealing its black paw pads.

Scene 5 (00:06–00:09): A golden British Shorthair cat's front paws are dipped into a white bowl of clear water, which then magically transforms into black ink.

Scene 6 (00:09–00:10): The golden British Shorthair cat curiously sniffs the black ink in the white bowl, where a calligraphy brush is already submerged.

Scene 7 (00:10–00:22): A close-up shows a person's hand skillfully drawing a dragon-themed Chinese character "福" on a red paper using a calligraphy brush. The strokes form the dragon's head, horns, mouth, and finally its tail and whiskers, integrating them into the character.

Scene 8 (00:22–00:24): A person proudly displays the finished red calligraphy paper with the dragon-stylized "福" character to a golden British Shorthair cat sitting beside it on the wooden floor. A green knitted Christmas tree is visible behind them.

Scene 9 (00:24–00:29): From an overhead view, four golden British Shorthair cats are lying in a neat row on a light rug, seemingly "drying" four newly created red calligraphy papers laid out on the wooden floor in front of them. The papers feature various dragon-themed designs and Chinese New Year greetings.
