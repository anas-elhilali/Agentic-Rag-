Here's a detailed description of the video scenes:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A golden British Shorthair kitten is sitting on a wooden floor, next to a tablet displaying a virtual blue bowl. A human hand pours a stream of white liquid, resembling milk, from a bottle onto the virtual bowl on the tablet screen.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:02): The same golden British Shorthair kitten is shown next to the tablet. A human hand uses a scooper to pour dark brown cat food kibble onto a virtual pink plate displayed on the tablet screen.
Scene 3 (00:02–00:04): Two golden British Shorthair cats are positioned on a light wooden floor, each in front of their own tablet. One tablet displays a virtual blue bowl with white liquid, and the other displays a virtual pink plate with dark kibble.
Scene 4 (00:04–00:06): From an overhead view, two golden British Shorthair cats are intently licking the screens of their respective tablets, attempting to consume the virtual milk and kibble. A close-up shows one cat's tongue actively licking the screen.
Scene 5 (00:06–00:08): A close-up of one golden British Shorthair cat continues to lick the tablet screen. It then stops and looks directly at the camera with a confused and wide-eyed expression.
Scene 6 (00:08–00:12): A golden British Shorthair cat is sitting on a wooden floor, looking at a transparent acrylic table placed in front of it. A human hand holds a scoop of cat food kibble on top of the table, then drops a single piece of kibble onto the transparent surface. The cat watches the kibble intently.
Scene 7 (00:12–00:16): The golden British Shorthair cat attempts to paw at the single piece of kibble through the transparent table, then looks up at the camera with a puzzled expression. It continues to try and reach the kibble, looking around for a solution.
Scene 8 (00:16–00:20): A larger pile of cat food kibble is poured onto the transparent acrylic table. The golden British Shorthair cat below looks up and excitedly bats at the transparent surface with its paws, trying to reach the food.
Scene 9 (00:20–00:24): The cat continues to bat and paw at the transparent table, attempting to get the kibble. A close-up from below the table shows the cat licking the transparent surface directly beneath the pile of food.
Scene 10 (00:24–00:29): Another golden British Shorthair cat enters the scene and sits next to the first cat under the transparent table. The second cat looks at the first cat with an annoyed or disapproving expression, then gives a light swat to the first cat.
Scene 11 (00:29–00:32): The first golden British Shorthair cat is shown sitting alone on the wooden floor, looking up at the camera with a visibly sad and dejected expression, then meows with its eyes closed.
Scene 12 (00:32–00:35): The sad cat sits with its head bowed, looking very defeated. A human hand gently pats its head in comfort.
Scene 13 (00:35–00:40): The first golden British Shorthair cat is back under the transparent table, actively licking and pawing at the top surface, still trying to reach the kibble.
Scene 14 (00:40–00:46): Both golden British Shorthair cats are now under the transparent table. Both cats are looking up and licking the transparent surface directly beneath the pile of kibble, each attempting to get the food through the barrier.
