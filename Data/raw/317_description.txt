Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on a light wooden floor, facing away from the camera, intently looking at its reflection in a mirror.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:02): The cat continues to gaze at its distorted reflection in the mirror, which appears wide and squashed, displaying a look of confusion.
Scene 3 (00:02–00:04): Close-up on the cat's face, now comically squished and with an unhappy expression, as it observes its altered reflection.
Scene 4 (00:04–00:05): The cat's face appears with exaggerated large, round eyes, looking innocent and surprised while gazing into the mirror.
Scene 5 (00:05–00:07): The cat stands on its hind legs, playfully batting at its distorted reflection in the mirror with its front paws, seemingly trying to interact with it.
Scene 6 (00:07–00:08): The cat sits down again, looking at its reflection, which now shows one eye comically enlarged and the other normal, creating an unusual asymmetry.
Scene 7 (00:08–00:09): The cat sits, looking at its reflection, which is now distorted to show a wide-open mouth, resembling a scream or laugh.
Scene 8 (00:09–00:10): The cat sits on the floor, looking up at its reflection, which briefly appears normal before distorting again.
Scene 9 (00:10–00:11): The cat looks into the mirror, and its reflection appears vertically stretched, making it look tall and thin.
Scene 10 (00:11–00:12): The cat looks at the mirror, and its reflection appears horizontally stretched, making it look wide and short.
Scene 11 (00:12–00:14): The cat observes multiple distorted reflections of itself lined up in the mirror, each with a different comical distortion, appearing bewildered.
Scene 12 (00:14–00:18): Four distorted reflections of the cat are shown side by side in the mirror, each with a unique funny alteration, while the actual cat looks up at them with a slightly perplexed or annoyed expression.
