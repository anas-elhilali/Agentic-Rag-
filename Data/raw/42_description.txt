Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): A golden British Shorthair cat sits in front of a tablet displaying a blue plate. A human hand pours virtual milk from a pink bottle onto the virtual plate, and the cat reaches out its paw towards the screen, appearing to try and touch the milk.

Scene 2 (00:04–00:08): The tablet now displays a pink plate. A human hand pours virtual kibble from a white scoop onto the virtual plate. The cat watches intently, then lowers its head and attempts to eat the virtual cat food from the tablet.

Scene 3 (00:08–00:11): Two golden British Shorthair cats are shown. The cat on the left tries to "drink" from a virtual blue plate of milk on its tablet, while the cat on the right tries to "eat" virtual kibble from a pink plate on its tablet. Both cats appear confused as they lick and paw at the screens.
