Here's a detailed description of the video, broken down by scenes with timestamps:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:01): A wide shot shows seven golden British Shorthair cats of varying fur lengths (some long-haired, some short-haired) lying in a straight line on a pink striped bedsheet, all with their paws tucked under their bodies.

Scene 2 (00:01-00:05): A close-up of a golden British Shorthair cat sitting on a white textured rug with its paws tucked. This is followed by a group of four golden British Shorthair cats (short-haired) sitting in a row on a grey sofa, all with their paws tucked. Then, five golden British Shorthair cats (short-haired) are seen sitting in a row on a white textured rug, also with their paws tucked.

Scene 3 (00:05-00:10): Seven golden British Shorthair cats are positioned in two rows; three long-haired cats sit on a white media console, and four short-haired cats sit on the wooden floor in front of them, all facing forward.

Scene 4 (00:10-00:14): A person's hand holds a dried fish to the noses of a line of five golden British Shorthair cats sitting on a wooden floor, who watch the fish intently. The hand then brings the dried fish to the person's own mouth as if to eat it.

Scene 5 (00:14-00:16): The five cats from the previous scene are now standing on the wooden floor, looking confused and slightly annoyed. Then, three golden British Shorthair cats are shown eating dry kibble from individual bowls on a wooden cat feeder.

Scene 6 (00:16-00:23): A person's hand places a black bowl of noodles (Luosifen) on the wooden floor next to the cats. The cats look up from their food with expressions of mild disgust. The hand then places an open durian fruit next to the bowl of noodles, followed by a cup of stinky tofu, completing a trio of strong-smelling foods.

Scene 7 (00:23-00:29): A close-up of a golden British Shorthair cat sitting on the floor, looking at the durian with a disgusted expression, sniffing it and recoiling. The cat then looks directly at the camera with wide, seemingly appalled eyes, before making a visible retching motion, appearing highly disgusted.

Scene 8 (00:29-00:32): A black and white marbled cat walks towards the durian and begins scratching the wooden floor next to it, as if trying to bury the foul smell. A golden British Shorthair cat watches from behind.

Scene 9 (00:32-00:37): A person is lying on a pink bedsheet, engrossed in a mobile phone. Around them, several golden British Shorthair cats (both long and short-haired) are sprawled on the bed, looking neglected. A close-up shows one short-haired golden British Shorthair cat sitting on the bed, looking sad and dejected. Two long-haired golden British Shorthair cats lie on the bed with paws tucked, also appearing sad.

Scene 10 (00:37-00:40): A person's finger attempts to touch a sad-looking golden British Shorthair cat sitting on the bed, but the cat flinches away and continues to look downcast.

Scene 11 (00:40-00:45): The video concludes with a wide shot of all seven golden British Shorthair cats (a mix of long and short-haired) lying in a perfect row on the pink bed, all with their paws tucked, appearing collectively sad or annoyed.
