Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:07): Three golden British Shorthair cats sit calmly behind a cardboard box laid flat. A hand spins a red and pink spinner on the box, which has sections drawn on it, resembling a game board. The spinner consistently lands on a section that the cats appear displeased with, given their solemn expressions.

Scene 2 (00:07-00:09): A person's foot abruptly kicks and crushes the cardboard box, causing the cats to flinch and look startled.
