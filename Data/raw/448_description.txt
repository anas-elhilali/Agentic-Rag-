Here's a detailed description of the video, broken down by scenes:

Scene 1 (00:02–00:03): First-person perspective showing a person's legs wearing grey slippers, seated on a white and brown speckled tiled bathroom floor.
Scene 2 (00:03–00:05): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on the speckled tiled floor next to a pink bowl of kibble, looking directly at the camera. The cat then opens its mouth as if meowing loudly or expressing distress.
Scene 3 (00:05–00:06): The golden British Shorthair cat stands on its hind legs, pushing its head against a closed light-colored cabinet door on the speckled tiled floor, seemingly trying to get away.
Scene 4 (00:06–00:09): The golden British Shorthair cat sits calmly near a white doorframe on a light wooden floor, looking towards the camera. A hand gestures for the cat to approach, but the cat turns and walks away. Another golden British Shorthair cat is visible further in the background near a cat tower.
Scene 5 (00:09–00:12): A close-up of a hand reaching for a white package of tissues on the speckled tiled bathroom floor.
Scene 6 (00:12–00:20): A hand holds a blue plate containing raw meat towards the camera. A golden British Shorthair cat approaches the plate on the wooden floor and begins to eat. The hand then opens a small white bottle and sprinkles a white substance (from a capsule) onto the meat. The cat continues eating.
Scene 7 (00:20–00:22): The scene returns to the first-person perspective, showing the person's legs in grey slippers on the speckled tiled bathroom floor.
Scene 8 (00:22–00:24): The golden British Shorthair cat sits beside the blue plate with raw meat on the wooden floor, looking curiously at the camera as a hand reaches into the frame towards it.
Scene 9 (00:24–00:29): A close-up of the golden British Shorthair cat being held securely by two hands. The cat looks directly at the camera while one hand gently strokes its fur on its chest. The cat then reacts with a slight expression of annoyance or discomfort before being quickly moved or released.
