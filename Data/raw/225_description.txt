Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:01): Four identical golden British Shorthair cats are lying in a perfect row on a light-colored sofa, looking down. A human hand holding a small blue book enters the frame from the bottom.
Scene 2 (00:01-00:03): The cats lift their heads, looking curiously at the blue book held by the human hand.
Scene 3 (00:03-00:06): A closer shot focuses on two of the cats as the human hand opens the blue book, revealing it is filled with stacks of 100 Yuan banknotes.
