Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A person is sweeping the floor in a brightly lit living room, which contains various cat furniture and accessories, including a large cat tree and multiple cat beds.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:04): The camera moves into a bathroom, showing a white toilet with its lid open, then pans to the side, revealing the plumbing connection behind it.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:07): A golden British Shorthair cat with wide green eyes slowly peeks out from behind the toilet, looking cautious, before partially retreating.
Scene 4 (00:07–00:09): The golden British Shorthair cat peeks its head out from behind the toilet again, looking intently with wide eyes.
Scene 5 (00:09–00:12): The camera pulls back to reveal the entire toilet, with the golden British Shorthair cat almost completely hidden behind it, nestled next to a yellow toilet brush holder.
