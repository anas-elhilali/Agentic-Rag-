Scene 16 (00:31–00:33): A long shot reveals all four golden British Shorthair cats seated in their individual yellow cardboard boxes, which are lined up to form a "bus" or "train." The cat in the first box is clearly visible, while the others extend further back in the line.

Scene 17 (00:33–00:35): A human hand is shown connecting two yellow cardboard boxes with a yellow string, transforming them into linked train carriages. One cat is seated in a box, facing away, while the other box is filled with cat food and supplies.
