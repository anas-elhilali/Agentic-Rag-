Scene 3 (00:05–00:07): A third golden British Shorthair cat sits alone on the wooden floor, looking away from the dispenser with an indifferent expression.

Scene 5 (00:08–00:11): The third golden British Shorthair cat walks away from the dispenser, down a hallway, and disappears around a corner.
Scene 6 (00:11–00:13): The camera moves closer to a bathroom door that is slightly ajar.
Scene 7 (00:13–00:16): The golden British Shorthair cat is found perched on the rim of a white toilet, drinking directly from the bowl, which contains glowing blue water. The cat then looks up at the camera with mischievous glowing red eyes.
