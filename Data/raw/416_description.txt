Scene 1 (00:00-00:02): A large golden British Shorthair cat vigorously licks the head of a small golden British Shorthair kitten, who is resting on a white blanket inside a wooden box. The kitten closes its eyes as it's being licked.
Scene 2 (00:02-00:04): Human hands hold up the golden kitten. Its head fur is wet and matted into spiky points from the intense licking, making it look disheveled.
Scene 3 (00:04-00:07): The golden kitten sits on a light-colored rug, looking down with a dejected expression. Its spiky fur remains prominent on its head.
Scene 4 (00:07-00:09): The golden kitten stands on its hind legs on the rug, using its front paws to desperately rub and attempt to clean its messy, spiky head fur, appearing distressed.
Scene 5 (00:09-00:10): A large gray tabby cat approaches the golden kitten and sniffs its head, appearing curious about the kitten's condition.
Scene 6 (00:10-00:13): The gray tabby cat sits up, wide-eyed, then opens its mouth as if gagging or expressing extreme disgust. It then leans into the wooden box, sniffing deeply, and recoils with a look of revulsion.
