Here is a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A golden British Shorthair kitten sits on a yellow and white plaid blanket. A human hand gently pets its head, and the kitten meows with its mouth open. Beside the kitten are small pieces of black seaweed and salmon on white paper.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:02): Two human feet are positioned on either side of the kitten, as if gently molding its body while it sits on the plaid blanket.
Scene 3 (00:02–00:05): A human hand gently cups and molds the kitten's face and chin while it sits on the blanket. The seaweed and salmon remain next to it.
Scene 4 (00:05–00:06): A human hand places a slice of salmon onto the kitten's back.
Scene 5 (00:06–00:08): A human hand wraps a strip of black seaweed around the kitten's belly, making it resemble a sushi roll.
Scene 6 (00:08–00:10): Two chopsticks are gently placed on either side of the kitten, which is now wrapped in seaweed like a sushi roll, sitting on the blanket.
Scene 7 (00:10–00:11): A person holds the "sushi" kitten in their hand, and another person playfully leans in close, making a motion as if to eat the kitten.
