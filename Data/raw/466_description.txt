Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:05): A small, light ginger kitten is deeply asleep on a light blue duvet on a bed, its face buried in the fabric. In the background, plush toys and plants are visible on a windowsill.
Scene 2 (00:05–00:08): A human hand gently pokes the sleeping kitten on its head/ear, attempting to wake it. The kitten remains undisturbed.
Scene 3 (00:08–00:12): The kitten suddenly lifts its head and shifts its body, looking slightly irritated as if it has just been woken up by the poking.
