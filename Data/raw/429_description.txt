Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:07): A small, golden British Shorthair kitten sits alone on a pink bed. The kitten appears distressed, repeatedly opening its mouth as if meowing or crying loudly, looking around with wide, dark eyes, and occasionally closing its eyes or looking down.

Scene 2 (00:07–00:10): A larger golden British Shorthair cat, presumably the mother, approaches the crying kitten on the bed. The mother cat then gently picks up the kitten by the scruff of its neck and carries it away.
