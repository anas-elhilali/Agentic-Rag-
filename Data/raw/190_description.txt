Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:02): A blurred, monochrome shot of a person lying in bed, transitioning into a slightly clearer, wider view of the same.
Scene 2 (00:02-00:05): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up on a bed with a pink pillow, looking directly at the camera with grumpy expressions.
Scene 3 (00:05-00:06): A close-up of two golden British Shorthair cats on the bed, as a person's hand reaches out to one, which then appears to flinch or move away.
Scene 4 (00:06-00:09): A person's hand holds up a small, colorful packet (resembling a nasal strip package) in front of a golden British Shorthair cat, which looks at the item.
Scene 5 (00:09-00:11): A person's hand closes a light-colored wooden door.
Scene 6 (00:11-00:12): A green cat litter box is placed on a light-colored floor, next to a white bag of cat litter.
Scene 7 (00:12-00:13): A golden British Shorthair cat peeks its head over a white bag of cat litter, positioned beside a green litter box.
Scene 8 (00:13-00:14): A person's hand displays various small components (pellets, a blue bead) of cat litter above a green litter box, with a cat partially visible in the frame.
Scene 9 (00:14-00:16): A hand uses a white scoop to demonstrate the clumping action of the cat litter within the green litter box.
Scene 10 (00:16-00:17): A black screen with abstract purple floral patterns, serving as a visual transition.
Scene 11 (00:17-00:18): A monochrome night vision shot shows a person sleeping soundly in a bed, with four light-colored cats resting on checkered mats attached to the sides of the bed. A visual effect of a "fart" cloud appears above the sleeping person.
Scene 12 (00:18-00:19): In night vision, the four light-colored cats on their mats turn their heads to look curiously towards the sleeping person.
Scene 13 (00:19-00:21): In night vision, one of the light-colored cats jumps onto the main bed and approaches the sleeping person, sniffing the air nearby.
Scene 14 (00:21-00:22): In night vision, the light-colored cat on the bed recoils abruptly and shakes its head vigorously, as if reacting to an unpleasant smell. The other cats on the mats also show signs of discomfort.
Scene 15 (00:22-00:23): A close-up night vision shot of the light-colored cat on the bed, intensely shaking its head and backing away rapidly.
Scene 16 (00:23-00:25): In night vision, three light-colored cats are seen desperately climbing up the vertical door frame, one on top of the other, appearing to try and escape the room. Another cat is sitting slightly further away.
