Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): A golden British Shorthair cat is perched inside a light green litter box filled with yellow litter. A hand holds a clear plastic cup and a metal scooper containing yellow, lumpy objects resembling cat waste, which are deposited into the cup. The cat observes the action with a curious and slightly confused expression, turning its head to watch.

Scene 2 (00:04–00:08): A wider shot reveals a mock "cat coffee shop" setup. One golden British Shorthair cat is inside the light green litter box, appearing to "prepare" drinks by digging in the yellow litter. Another golden British Shorthair cat sits patiently next to a white box that holds three clear plastic cups, seemingly waiting in line for a drink. The "coffee shop" features a wooden frame structure with decorative banners.

Scene 3 (00:08–00:10): A close-up of the three clear plastic cups, which are filled with dark pellets at the bottom and topped with the yellow, lumpy material. A hand reaches in and picks up one of the cups, which has a white straw inserted into it.

Scene 4 (00:10–00:13): A top-down view shows the contents of the chosen plastic cup with the white straw. The straw is moved as if to take a sip, but then quickly pulls away, conveying a sense of aversion or disgust.
