Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): A golden British Shorthair cat sits in a loaf position on a gray cushion, its head tucked down. A human hand repeatedly pokes the cat's side, but the cat largely ignores it, occasionally flinching slightly.
Scene 2 (00:04–00:06): The cat lifts its head briefly to give the poking hand a mild, annoyed glance, then slightly adjusts its body on the cushion.
Scene 3 (00:06–00:09): The cat, now in a slightly different spot, continues to be poked. It reacts by turning its head and giving side-eyed glances towards the hand, showing growing irritation.
Scene 4 (00:09–00:14): The cat actively tries to evade the poking hand by shifting its body away. It then makes a quick batting motion with its paw and finally looks directly at the camera with a visibly exasperated expression before tucking its paws tightly under itself.
