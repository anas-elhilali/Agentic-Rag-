Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A close-up shot of a white toilet with the lid open. Inside the toilet bowl, a toilet paper roll is floating in the water, illuminated by a blue light from the smart toilet.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on a white tiled floor with black and brown specks, looking up with curious blue eyes.
Scene 3 (00:03–00:06): A person's hands hold the golden British Shorthair cat over the toilet bowl, attempting to lower its front paws into the water. The cat appears hesitant and uncomfortable.
Scene 4 (00:06–00:09): The cat's front paw is guided into the toilet paper roll floating in the toilet bowl. The cat strains to reach the roll.
Scene 5 (00:09–00:10): The cat successfully uses its paw to grasp and pull the wet toilet paper roll out of the toilet bowl.
Scene 6 (00:10–00:12): The person lifts the golden British Shorthair cat out of the toilet. The cat's fur is slightly wet, and it looks visibly annoyed or startled, with its front paws splayed out.
