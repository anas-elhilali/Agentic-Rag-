Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:05): A hand repeatedly presses a red voice button, which states 'drink water,' on a pink striped bed. A white enamel mug sits beside it.
Scene 2 (00:05–00:12): The camera pans up to show four golden British Shorthair cats neatly lined up on the pink bed. A hand holds the white mug in front of them, while a voice repeatedly says 'drink water,' causing the cats to look confused.
