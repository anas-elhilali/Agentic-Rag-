Here is a description of the video for your script-generating model:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:05): A wide shot shows an owner lying in bed, covered by a light blue duvet. Several golden British Shorthair cats are seen jumping, walking, and lying on top of the duvet, seemingly disturbing the sleeping owner. One tabby cat is also on the bed.

Scene 2 (00:05–00:13): The scene shifts to night vision (black and white). The owner is still in bed. The duvet is now covered with black anti-cat spike mats. Three white cats are visible; one is sitting on the headboard, another on a bedside table, and a third one attempts to jump onto the bed but lands on the spike mat, then cautiously steps around it.

Scene 3 (00:13–00:17): Still in night vision, a large white wire cage has been constructed around the entire bed, enclosing the owner. Several white cats with glowing eyes are visible sitting outside the cage on the floor and on the headboard.

Scene 4 (00:17–00:20): Inside the cage, a white cat is lying beside the sleeping owner. The cat then sniffs the air and walks away, reacting to an unidentifiable smell or sound.

Scene 5 (00:20–00:23): The white cat is seen again inside the cage, near the owner. A "poof" graphic appears near the cat, and the cat reacts by sniffing the air and running away.

Scene 6 (00:23–00:28): The white cat, still inside the cage, reacts strongly to a loud sound by jumping up with wide eyes and quickly running away.

Scene 7 (00:28–00:30): The video switches back to color. A golden British Shorthair cat sits on a pink bedsheet, looking down and appearing upset.

Scene 8 (00:30–00:33): A human hand gently strokes the head of the golden British Shorthair cat. The camera then pans to show light brown stains and cat hair on the pink bedsheet, suggesting mess.

Scene 9 (00:33–00:35): The golden British Shorthair cat looks up at the camera with wide, innocent eyes.

Scene 10 (00:35–00:37): A top-down view shows two golden British Shorthair cats lying on the pink bedsheet. A human hand gently pets one of the cats on the head.

Scene 11 (00:37–00:40): A wide shot reveals the owner sleeping inside a newly constructed, large white wire cage that completely encloses the bed. Several golden British Shorthair cats are visible on the floor outside the cage.

Scene 12 (00:40–00:44): The camera pans around the large wire cage, showing its full extent. One golden British Shorthair cat sits on the floor outside the cage, looking up at the bed with a longing expression.

Scene 13 (00:44–00:46): A golden British Shorthair cat stands on its hind legs and paws at the wire mesh of the cage, attempting to climb up or get inside.

Scene 14 (00:46–00:49): A final wide shot shows the large, enclosed bed with the owner inside, and multiple golden British Shorthair cats sitting on the floor around the cage, looking forlorn.
