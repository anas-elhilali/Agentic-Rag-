Scene 4 (00:07–00:08): A top-down view from inside the playpen shows the golden kitten standing on its hind legs, looking up with wide eyes and an open mouth. A human hand reaches into the frame from the top.

Scene 21 (00:37–00:44): A person is kneeling on the wooden floor, repeatedly bowing towards the white TV console. Four golden adult cats are lined up on the console, observing the person, alongside the white LEGO cat. Yellow coin-like objects appear on the console in front of the cats.
