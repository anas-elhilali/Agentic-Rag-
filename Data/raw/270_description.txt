Scene 1 (00:00–00:04): A person lies in bed, partially covered by a pink striped duvet, holding a smartphone in their hands. Their face is mostly obscured as they look at the phone screen.
Scene 2 (00:05–00:08): The person raises the phone, revealing its screen. The screen displays a clear image of three small, light orange and cream-colored kittens nestled together under a pink blanket, looking directly at the camera.
