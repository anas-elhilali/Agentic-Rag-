Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): Close-up of a small, fluffy golden British Shorthair kitten lying on a yellow and orange striped surface next to a baby bottle filled with milk. The kitten is seen licking its paw or mouth, appearing full or sleepy.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:08): A person's hands gently hold the golden British Shorthair kitten upright. The kitten looks very sleepy and is trying to suckle on its own paw.
Scene 3 (00:08–00:13): An adult golden British Shorthair cat is resting on a white, modern sofa. A person in patterned pajamas walks up and sits down next to the cat, then starts petting it while looking at their phone.
Scene 4 (00:13–00:19): The person stands up and walks away from the sofa, but their arm remains on the couch, continuing to pet the cat. The cat turns its head, looking confused at the disembodied hand.
Scene 5 (00:19–00:21): The detached hand moves slightly, startling the cat, which then quickly jumps off the sofa.
Scene 6 (00:21–00:32): Two golden British Shorthair cats are in a bathroom, looking at a toilet bowl that has been filled with numerous thumbtacks. One cat is peering into the toilet, while the other sits beside it, appearing annoyed or upset.
