Scene 1 (00:00-00:03): Close-up, low-angle shot of a golden British Shorthair cat's face peering down into the camera, its wide green-gold eyes looking directly at the viewer.

Scene 5 (00:11-00:12): A sudden, blurry, brown-toned shot as the camera moves, mimicking a person waking up and shifting.
Scene 6 (00:12-00:18): A hand repeatedly presses a red sound button on a pink striped bed, then picks up a white enamel mug with a blue rim and logo.
Scene 7 (00:18-00:23): Four golden British Shorthair cats lie neatly in a row on the pink striped bed, staring at the hand holding the white mug, with curious and questioning expressions.
Scene 8 (00:23-00:27): The four golden British Shorthair cats are now lined up on a white sofa. A hand displays three standard-sized red envelopes, then reveals a fourth, notably smaller red envelope.
Scene 9 (00:27-00:32): The four cats are shown with red envelopes in front of them: three large ones each topped with a fish-shaped treat, and one small, empty envelope. The cat in front of the small envelope looks up with wide, questioning eyes. As a hand pushes the small envelope, the cat uses its paw to push it back, then rests its paw on the envelope, appearing annoyed.
