Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A gray British Shorthair cat sits on a wooden floor, observing a clear, transparent acrylic table.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:03): Three golden British Shorthair cats, two adults and one smaller, gather around the transparent table. One small cat is positioned under the table, while the other two are outside.
Scene 3 (00:03–00:04): A hand pours dark cat food pellets onto the top surface of the transparent table, directly above the small cat under it.
Scene 4 (00:04–00:08): The small cat under the table looks up at the food. An adult golden cat outside the table stands on its hind legs, attempting to reach the food with its paws, while the small cat inside also tries to reach it.
Scene 5 (00:08–00:13): An adult golden cat is standing on its hind legs, leaning over the transparent table, eating the cat food directly from the top. Another smaller cat is visible looking up from under the table.
Scene 6 (00:13–00:17): A golden cat is sitting under the transparent table, first looking up at the food, then looking around. It then manages to push its head and shoulders through the gap between the table legs to reach and eat the food.
Scene 7 (00:17–00:20): A small golden cat (kitten) sits beside the transparent table, looking at the scattered food pellets remaining on its surface.
Scene 8 (00:20–00:25): A hand pours a generous amount of cat food pellets onto the transparent table, directly above the golden kitten sitting underneath. The kitten looks up attentively.
Scene 9 (00:25–00:29): The golden kitten under the table repeatedly attempts to lick the food from the table's underside, bumping its head against the transparent surface.
Scene 10 (00:29–00:30): A close-up shows the golden kitten under the table, continuing its futile attempts to lick the unreachable food.
Scene 11 (00:30–00:32): The golden kitten under the table is still struggling to reach the food from below, while an adult golden cat has successfully reached over the top of the table and is eating the food directly. Another adult cat is also visible approaching the food from above.
