Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:01–00:07): Two golden British Shorthair cats are nestled inside a cardboard box on a patterned cushion. One cat is awake and attentively watching a video on a small tablet propped against the box, while the other lies asleep beside it. The sleeping cat is gently nudged awake, and both cats then look towards the camera.
Scene 2 (00:08–00:15): A close-up view through a heart-shaped cutout in a cardboard box reveals multiple golden British Shorthair cats. The interior of the box is first illuminated with a red light, then changes to a blue light, as the cats look out with wide, curious eyes.
