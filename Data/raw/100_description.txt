Here's a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up, intently looking into a wooden box containing three small kittens (one ginger, two dark brown) sleeping on a white mat.
Scene 2 (00:03–00:05): The four adult golden British Shorthair cats are still observing the three kittens, who are huddled together in the wooden box.
Scene 3 (00:05–00:07): One adult golden British Shorthair cat is now lying inside the wooden box, nursing the three kittens, while the other three adult cats watch from outside the box.
Scene 4 (00:07–00:11): The three kittens are sleeping soundly in a small wooden swing bed with a yellow and white striped blanket, while an adult golden British Shorthair cat stands nearby, observing them.
Scene 5 (00:11–00:16): A person's hands gently hold a tiny, light ginger kitten, which is meowing or yawning with its mouth open, showing its small pink tongue. Another dark kitten is visible in the background in the wooden box.
