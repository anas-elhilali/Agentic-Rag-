Scene 5 (00:09–00:18): In night vision, the mother cat and kittens are in the wooden bed. The person in the main bed snores loudly, causing the motion-activated light to turn on repeatedly, disturbing the mother cat and her kittens, who show increasing signs of annoyance and tiredness.

Scene 12 (00:30–00:38): In night vision, the kittens are in their wooden bed. The mother cat snores from her green mat, repeatedly activating the light and disturbing her kittens, who appear confused and unable to sleep.
