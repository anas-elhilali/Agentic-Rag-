Here's the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A hand pulls a white tissue from a wall-mounted, orange-striped tabby cat-shaped tissue dispenser with green eyes.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:02): Three golden British Shorthair cats sit side-by-side on a light grey tiled floor, looking curiously at the camera.
Scene 3 (00:02–00:03): A hand points at the wall-mounted, orange-striped cat-shaped tissue dispenser.
Scene 4 (00:04–00:06): The three golden British Shorthair cats are on the tiled floor, looking intently towards a door frame, with one cat beginning to stand on its hind legs.
Scene 5 (00:06–00:09): One golden British Shorthair cat stands fully upright on its hind legs, stretching its front paws against a white door frame, as if trying to peer through a narrow gap, while the other two cats sit and watch it.
