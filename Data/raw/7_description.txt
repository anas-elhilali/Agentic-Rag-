Scene 1 (00:01-00:02): A golden British Shorthair cat sits patiently on the floor, looking towards a hand that is about to drop food onto a clear acrylic barrier in front of it. Another golden British Shorthair cat is visible in the background.
Scene 2 (00:02-00:03): A hand drops small, light-colored food cubes onto the clear acrylic barrier, directly above the first cat's head. The cat looks up as the food falls.

Scene 4 (00:05-00:08): The cat stands on its hind legs, reaching up and batting repeatedly at the clear barrier, attempting to get the food cubes from the top. Another golden British Shorthair cat is visible sleeping in the background.
Scene 5 (00:08-00:09): Still under the clear barrier, the cat looks up at the food cubes and sticks its tongue out, appearing to try and lick them through the clear surface.
Scene 6 (00:09-00:10): The cat sits on the floor under the clear barrier, looking up at the food cubes with its tongue slightly out.
