Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:02): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on a white carpet, observing intently as a person uses an air pump to inflate a small, flat cat-shaped toy next to it.
Scene 2 (00:02–00:05): The small toy fully inflates and transforms into a tiny, fluffy light-colored kitten, sitting upright on the carpet next to the larger golden cat, who looks at it curiously.
Scene 3 (00:05–00:07): The person deflates the kitten with the air pump, and it rapidly shrinks back into a small, flat toy, as the golden cat watches it disappear.
Scene 4 (00:07–00:10): The golden cat looks around with a puzzled expression, then directly at the camera, as if searching for the kitten that vanished.
