Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A man is sleeping soundly on a bed, partially covered by a striped pink blanket. A ginger cat with its eyes closed is snuggled next to his head, seemingly also asleep and emitting soft snoring sounds.
Scene 2 (00:03–00:07): The ginger cat's eyes abruptly open and glow a bright teal color. The cat looks directly at the camera with an irritated expression, then glances at the still-sleeping man.
Scene 3 (00:07–00:13): A hand gently reaches into the frame and strokes the ginger cat's head. The cat closes its eyes again, appearing to relax and settle back into a peaceful sleep while the man remains asleep.
