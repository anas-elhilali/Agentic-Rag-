Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A collection of various needle-felted golden cat figures of different sizes are arranged on a white rug, with four real golden British Shorthair cats sitting in a neat row behind them.
Scene 2 (00:03–00:06): On a wooden table, several needle-felted cat figures are displayed. One white British Shorthair cat sits near them, while two other white British Shorthair cats lie further back, all observing the figures.
Scene 3 (00:06–00:08): A person's hand gently attempts to pluck fur from the head of a white British Shorthair cat, which looks up inquisitively. The felted cat figures remain on the table.
Scene 4 (00:08–00:12): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up on the wooden table, watching as a hand continues to gently pull fur from the white cat's head, which is now lying down.
Scene 5 (00:12–00:16): A person's hands are shown needle-felting white wool on a grey foam mat, forming the basic body and head shapes of a cat. A white and a golden cat watch the process from the table.
Scene 6 (00:16–00:18): A fluffy white cat with brown markings (Ragdoll breed) stands on a beige carpet, looking forward. Another similar cat lies sprawled on the carpet.
Scene 7 (00:18–00:22): A close-up of the fluffy white and brown cat (Ragdoll) lying on a white couch. A person's hand gently pulls loose fur from its side. The cat then playfully nips the person's finger. An inset image shows small, white felted cat tails and legs.
Scene 8 (00:22–00:28): The fluffy white and brown cat (Ragdoll) on the carpet expresses discontent, meowing with its mouth open, while the person's hand is near. The cat then sits on a wooden step, surrounded by a large pile of its own shed fur.
Scene 9 (00:28–00:33): Hands meticulously add details to the small white felted cat: first, attaching tiny blue eyes, then adding a tail, and finally, refining the facial features and whiskers, with the real white cat observing in the background.
Scene 10 (00:33–00:38): The finished small white felted cat, a miniature replica, is held up and then placed on the wooden table next to the real white cat, which curiously sniffs the felted figure.
Scene 11 (00:38–00:43): The real white cat sits on the wooden table, surrounded by a large collection of various needle-felted cat figures of different breeds and colors, as well as some panda figures. A hand places the newly completed white felted cat among them.
