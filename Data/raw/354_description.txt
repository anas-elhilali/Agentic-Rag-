Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:05): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on a white coffee table, looking intently as a person's hands ignite a small stick, creating a long, bright flame that captures the cat's curious gaze.

Scene 2 (00:05-00:11): The cat's head is playfully replaced with a large red rose. A person holds a green stem with a miniature, digitally composited head of the same cat at its tip, resembling a unique flower. The rose-headed cat continues to observe the "cat-flower" held before it.
