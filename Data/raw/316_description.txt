Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:03): A person is on their hands and knees, looking under a light grey sofa. A cat's paw is visible from under the sofa, playfully batting at something.
Scene 2 (00:03–00:05): A golden British Shorthair cat sits on a wooden floor, looking towards a person who is sitting nearby. Another cat, possibly a Ragdoll, is visible in the background near a light yellow armchair.
Scene 3 (00:05–00:15): Security camera footage shows a person walking into a modern kitchen/living room area. Two golden British Shorthair cats are perched on top of a grey refrigerator, observing the person. The person bends down to look under a table, then stands and walks towards a door, seemingly searching for something, while the cats watch from their elevated position.
