Here's a description of the video, formatted as requested:

Scene 1 (00:00-00:01): An empty silver suitcase lies open on a light wooden floor.
Scene 2 (00:01-00:05): A golden British Shorthair cat enters the suitcase, followed by three more golden British Shorthair cats, one by one, snuggling together to neatly fill the bottom compartment of the suitcase.
Scene 3 (00:05-00:08): A gray tabby cat, then a large white and brown Ragdoll, and finally a small golden British Shorthair kitten enter the top lid compartment of the suitcase, filling it with cats.
Scene 4 (00:08-00:11): A very small golden British Shorthair kitten sits on the wooden floor next to the now completely full suitcase, looking towards the cats inside, seemingly unable to find a spot.
