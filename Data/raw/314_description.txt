Here is a description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:00–00:01): A golden British Shorthair cat is inside a yellow cardboard box shaped like a candy wrapper, biting and tearing at the edges of the opening. Another cat is partially visible in a red cat house beside it. Small pieces of torn cardboard are scattered on the floor.
Scene 2 (00:01–00:04): Close-up of the same cat continuing to chew and damage the cardboard box from the inside, with more torn pieces accumulating on the floor.
Scene 3 (00:04–00:06): The cat is settled inside the now significantly damaged cardboard box, which has a large, irregular opening. The cat is still seen biting the edges.
Scene 4 (00:06–00:08): Four golden British Shorthair cats are lined up on the floor, observing various craft materials, including colorful pom-poms, fabric swatches, and other decorative items, laid out in front of them.
Scene 5 (00:08–00:09): A person holds a large cardboard box, on which a circular outline is drawn, possibly for cutting an opening. A cat's paw is visible in the background.
Scene 6 (00:09–00:10): A person's hand points at a cardboard box with small paw print-shaped holes cut into one side, next to a craft knife.
Scene 7 (00:10–00:12): Inside the partially constructed cat house (a cardboard box), a person's hands are seen lining the interior with a white, fluffy fabric. The box features cut-out paw prints and heart shapes on its sides.
Scene 8 (00:12–00:13): A person holds a completed cat house, which is green with a white fluffy roof resembling snow and a round entrance. Scissors are on the floor nearby.
Scene 9 (00:13–00:15): A person pets a golden British Shorthair cat, then collects some of its shed fur and rolls it into a small ball.
Scene 10 (00:15–00:18): The person holds the small fur ball towards a cat sitting on a white rug, next to a finished cat house designed like a wrapped Christmas gift. The person then uses the fur ball to 'decorate' the gift box cat house.
Scene 11 (00:18–00:20): The cat is shown with digitally enlarged, cartoonish eyes, looking at the camera next to the gift box cat house.
Scene 12 (00:20–00:21): The cat, with normal eyes, appears agitated, with flattened ears and twitching paws, as if in frustration.
Scene 13 (00:21–00:23): A person's hand sweeps small pieces of debris (likely craft remnants) from the floor.
Scene 14 (00:23–00:25): A white robotic vacuum cleaner emerges from its charging station and begins to clean the floor.
Scene 15 (00:25–00:26): The scene displays a festive setup: a large red and white cat house shaped like a train engine, and a tall green Christmas tree-like structure made of paper.
Scene 16 (00:26–00:29): Four cats are positioned on top of four newly crafted cat houses, which are designed as gift boxes and vary in size. The cats and houses are arranged to resemble a train, with the train engine house at the front.
Scene 17 (00:29–00:31): Close-up of one cat, sitting on the smallest of the gift box houses, displaying a slightly annoyed expression.
Scene 18 (00:31–00:33): The same cat on the smallest house, with its eyes digitally exaggerated to appear upset.
Scene 19 (00:33–00:36): The cat on the smallest gift box house looks directly at the camera with an unhappy expression, framed by two larger gift box houses behind it. Its eyes are again digitally enlarged and cartoonish.
