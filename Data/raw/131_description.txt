Here is the description of the video:

Scene 1 (00:01–00:05): Three golden British Shorthair cats are seated attentively in a row before an automatic pet feeder. A human hand points towards the feeder and then discreetly operates a smartphone, presumably to control the feeder.
Scene 2 (00:05–00:09): The cats observe as kibble drops into the feeder's bowl. They appear surprised by the sudden appearance of food.
Scene 3 (00:09–00:13): One golden British Shorthair cat, positioned closer to the feeder, raises its paw and makes a waving motion towards the feeder. As it does, food dispenses, creating the illusion of the cat's "magic." Another golden British Shorthair cat observes from a red cat bed in the background.
Scene 4 (00:13–00:16): A second golden British Shorthair cat steps forward and mimics the paw-waving gesture towards the feeder, successfully causing more food to dispense. The cat in the red bed watches the action unfold.
Scene 5 (00:16–00:20): The golden British Shorthair cat that just received food approaches the feeder, curiously examining the newly dispensed kibble and then looking up towards the dispenser opening.
Scene 6 (00:20–00:23): The third golden British Shorthair cat, previously in the cat bed, sits in front of the feeder and repeatedly waves its paw, attempting to dispense food. No food appears.
Scene 7 (00:23–00:26): The third cat sniffs the empty food bowl, then looks up at the feeder with a look of confusion and slight frustration.
Scene 8 (00:26–00:28): A close-up shot of a bag of cat food and a white scooper.
Scene 9 (00:28–00:32): A human scoops cat food from the bag and pours it into the empty bowl while the third cat watches intently, then begins to eat.
Scene 10 (00:32–00:33): A human pours cat food from a scoop into the main compartment of the automatic feeder.
Scene 11 (00:33–00:36): The third golden British Shorthair cat is seated expectantly in front of the refilled feeder, looking up with a hopeful expression.
Scene 12 (00:36–00:38): The cat once again tries waving its paw at the feeder. No food is dispensed, and the cat looks down at the bowl in disappointment.
Scene 13 (00:38–00:40): The golden British Shorthair cat lies down on the floor, appearing dejected and frustrated. A human hand is visible next to it.
